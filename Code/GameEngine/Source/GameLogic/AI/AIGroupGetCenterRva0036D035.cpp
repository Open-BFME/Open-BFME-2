// BFME AIGroup centroid, RVA 0x00151E50, 222 bytes.
// Based on GeneralsMD AIGroup.cpp; BFME additionally requires isMobile() in
// the AI-only pass. If that pass is empty, include all non-held members.
// Keep the actual STLport list/iterator: a raw-node replica changes EBX/EBP
// assignment despite having the same pointer layout and traversal behavior.
