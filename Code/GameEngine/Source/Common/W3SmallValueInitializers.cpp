// Open-BFME-1: two small value-type bodies out of d_0001466e.asm.
//
// 0x000643C0 opens with `mov eax,ecx`, which is the constructor tell, and takes
// one argument (`ret 4`). It writes seven consecutive dwords in ASCENDING order
// -- and MSVC 7.1 does not reorder straight-line constant stores, so that is
// source order: four zeros, two copies of 0x3F000000, then the argument. The
// two 0x3F000000 stores go through ONE register loaded once, which is what says
// they are the same constant written twice rather than two unrelated values,
// and 0x3F000000 is 0.5f -- an integer move of a float constant is how MSVC 7.1
// spells a float initialiser whose bit pattern it already knows.
//
// 0x000643F0 copies three consecutive dwords out of the object into a caller
// supplied block, again in ascending order. It leaves eax alone, so it is NOT a
// by-value return through a hidden pointer (which would have to return that
// pointer) -- it is a void member taking a destination.
//
// Identity is address-derived: the offsets are what retail writes, the member
// names are the offsets.
