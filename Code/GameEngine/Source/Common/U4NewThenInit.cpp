// Bodies ported from Open-BFME-1's GameEngine/Source/Common/U4NewThenInit.cpp
// (donor revision 6d9434269164392c5ba62aaa7c15a86b5b020d76, donor flags plus
// /O1). Compiled that way each body below places uniquely on unclaimed
// game.dat .text by masked whole-.text search, and ./build.sh reproduces it
// byte for byte: U4Maker005EA530::make 0x003ADCEB (32B). Callee addresses are
// read off retail's call sites (reverse/symbols.csv). Only the placed bodies
// are carried; the donor's other definitions are omitted.
//
// Two heap allocations followed by a constructor -- MSVC 7.1's whole `new T`
// sequence, and nothing else.
//
// 0x005EA530 (34 bytes):
//
//     push esi / push 0xB0 / mov esi,ecx / call ??2@YAPAXI@Z / add esp,4
//     test eax,eax / je NULL / push esi / mov ecx,eax / call <CTOR>
//     pop esi / ret
//     NULL: xor eax,eax / pop esi / ret
//
// WHAT THE BYTES SHOW.  `operator new` is called with a literal size, its
// result is tested, and on success it becomes the `this` of a __thiscall
// constructor whose one argument is the RECEIVER OF THIS FUNCTION.  That
// null-test-then-construct, with a `xor eax,eax` arm that returns the null the
// allocator gave back, is exactly what MSVC 7.1 emits for `new T(args)` under
// the non-throwing operator new this image links -- the source contains no test
// of its own.  0xB0 is `sizeof(T)`, and the object being constructed is
// returned unchanged, so the whole body is `return new T(this);`.
//
// 0x0060CD80 (56 bytes) allocates 0x74 the same way and then does two more
// things with the result:
//
//     ... new (0x74) ... / mov esi,eax  (or esi=0)
//     mov ecx,[esp+8] / push <TABLE> / push esi
//     call ?initFromINI@INI@@QAEXPAXPBUFieldParse@@@Z
//     mov eax,[<GLOBAL>] / mov [eax+0x28C],esi / pop esi / ret
//
// `initFromINI` is already in the ledger at 0x008520A0 and is __thiscall on an
// `INI *`; the receiver it gets is this function's only stack argument, so this
// is an INI block handler.  Its two pushed arguments are the fresh object and a
// .rdata address -- a `FieldParse` table -- in that order.  Then a global
// pointer is loaded and the fresh object is parked at +0x28C of whatever it
// points at.  The `eb 02 / xor esi,esi` merge is the same allocator null arm as
// above, here folded into a register rather than duplicated returns because the
// tail is shared.
//
// EXCEPTION FLAGS ARE EVIDENCE.  Under the project default (`-EHsc-`, which cl
// reads as EHs ON) both bodies gain a three-push fs:[0] frame and, in
// 0x0060CD80, an EH-state store around the constructed object -- 62 and 50
// bytes of difference.  Retail has neither, hence this file's `/EHs-c-`.
//
// WHICH INI KEY REACHES 0x0060CD80 IS READ OUT OF THE EXE.  The
// LivingWorldMapInfo block (parsed by 0x0060D6B0) has a 71-entry FieldParse
// table at 0x01116000, and its `EyeTower` entry points here; the .rdata address
// this body pushes is that key's own four-field sub-table -- PupilAnimObject,
// PupilBeamAnimObject, EyeDecalAnimObject, EyeDecalBeamAnimObject
// (docs/ini_schema.md). Hence the name: this is the `EyeTower = ` handler, and
// the global it parks the parsed block in at +0x28C is the map-info singleton.
//
// THE REST IS NOT RECOVERED.  0x005EA530 has no INI reach and keeps its
// address-derived name, as do both constructors (pinned by the addresses their
// REL32s resolve to), the FieldParse table and the global (DIR32 operands
// copied from retail); `char m_body[]` carries only the size `operator new`
// was asked for.
