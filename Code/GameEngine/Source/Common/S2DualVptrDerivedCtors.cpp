// Two __thiscall constructors of classes with TWO polymorphic bases, whose
// whole body is the base constructor and the three vptr stores that follow it:
//
//     push esi / mov esi,ecx / call <REL32>
//     mov dword ptr [esi+8],<VFTABLE-OF-SECOND-BASE>
//     mov dword ptr [esi],<OWN-VFTABLE-FOR-FIRST>
//     mov dword ptr [esi+8],<OWN-VFTABLE-FOR-SECOND>
//     mov eax,esi / pop esi / ret
//
// WHAT THE BYTES SHOW.  The slot at +8 is written twice, first with one address
// and then with another, which is exactly what a second base with an inline
// (compiler-generated) constructor followed by the derived class's own vptr
// fix-up looks like.  Only ONE base constructor is called, so the other base
// has no user-written constructor; the base at +8 puts the first base's size at
// eight bytes -- a vptr and one dword.  Nothing else is initialised.
//
// THE SECOND BASE IS SHARED.  Both rows store 0x01073744 into +8 before their
// own fix-up, so both derive from the same second base; the called base
// constructor 0x009A1A30 is already pinned in reverse/symbols.csv.
//
// IDENTITY IS NOT RECOVERED.  Names are address-derived.  The bytes do not say
// what the two bases are called, nor whether the derived classes add virtuals
// of their own -- only that each has its own vftable for each base.
