// ?processAckStage1@BFMEConnectionManager@@IAEXPAVNetCommandMsg@@@Z
// retail 0x004CFCD1, 53 bytes. Dedicated TU ported
// from the Open-BFME-1 donor
// game/GameEngine/Source/GameNetwork/ConnectionManager_processAck.cpp
// (reference/open-bfme-1). The donor body is byte-identical to retail once
// relocations are masked. Only the placed body is defined here; the donor's
// other definition (processAck, 0x006658F0) is omitted.
//
// The reference's three-way dispatch: ACKBOTH runs both stages, ACKSTAGE1 the
// first, ACKSTAGE2 the second. Stage two is the ledger's
// ?processAckCommand@BFMEConnectionManager@@QAEXPAX@Z at 0x00665700; stage one
// is inlined here, which is why it appears twice in the body.
//
// BFME's stage one is the reference's minus its latency bookkeeping: the
// reference checks whether the acknowledged command was a FRAMEINFO and feeds
// its frame to m_frameMetrics.processLatencyResponse. Retail does no such thing
// -- it deletes the returned reference and stops. That is one more piece of the
// adaptive-latency layer that FINDINGS already shows is absent.
