// BfmeThingDGD constructor, retail 0x007F7FA0, 228 bytes. The matched
// allocator wrapper at 0x007F86A0 allocates 0x6E0 bytes and calls this body,
// and the scalar deleting destructor at 0x007F86D0 frees the same 0x6E0 after
// calling the destructor at 0x007F8090. The layout matches the destructor
// source beside this one.
//
// The two base levels are what order the five vftable stores. Retail writes
// the pair at +4 and +8 first, then all three again, which is what a base
// constructor followed by a derived one produces. The four child records and
// the two small members construct themselves, so the compiler places the edi
// save between them the way retail does. The root pair writes through a
// volatile cast, because the derived constructor overwrites both words and
// the optimiser drops a plain store it can see overwritten. The derived
// three stay plain, which is what lets the zero constant materialise ahead
// of them.
// The compiler-generated vector constructor iterator (??_H) takes the
// optimization state of the first function that needs it. Retail links one
// copy, the /O1 body at 0x00001423; this unemitted anchor makes this unit's
// copy that same body, so it no longer loses to retail's at link time.
// It can also change how later array constructions here compile; checked to
// change nothing else in this unit, but if a function added later that builds
// an array will not match, try it without this block.
