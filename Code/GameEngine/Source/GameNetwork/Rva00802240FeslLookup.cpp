// FESL browser lookup at retail 0x00802240 (44B).
//
// Identity is address-derived.  The matched Rva00802380Owner constructor at
// 0x00802330 installs vtable 0x0112C534, whose slot 4 is this body.  Its
// matched getters and destructor establish the owner fields used here:
// m_host at +4, the returned pointer array at +0x28, and the surrounding
// members at +8, +0x10/+0x14 and +0x24.  Only the lookup vector's observed
// host offset is modeled below; the preceding host bytes remain opaque.
//
// The six family callers of 0x007f76f0 load this same host into ECX, push the
// key, then form the vector address with LEA from that receiver.  The helper
// is therefore declared as a neutral host member with the ordinary thiscall ABI:
// host receiver, while its two explicit arguments are the vector and the
// const char key.  Its retail body returns an index and cleans 8 bytes.
