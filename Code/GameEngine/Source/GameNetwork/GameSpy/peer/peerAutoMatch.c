/* BFME2: the complete predicate independently places at RVA0x006996E0.
   Its auto-match status member also feeds the verified type-33 callback.
   Historical addresses below refer to the BFME1 reconstruction. */
/* GameSpy Peer SDK -- peerIsAutoMatching, retail 0x00858120, 26 bytes,
   reconstructed from the retail bytes; the declarations are local for the same
   reason peerHost.c's next door are.

   The identification is not a guess.  The body reads exactly one member,
   [peer+0x18d4], and peerCallbacks.c reaches that same slot from
   piAddAutoMatchStatusCallback, where its value becomes the params of a
   PI_AUTO_MATCH_STATUS callback -- so the member is the auto-match status and
   this predicate is "is an auto-match still running".  The constant it
   compares against is 5, the last of the six PEERAutoMatchStatus values, which
   is what makes the comparison a completion test rather than an arbitrary one.

   A zero status returns straight out on the register the load left, without a
   fresh zeroing: retail's `ret` at 0x0085812E is that path.  */
