/* GameSpy SDK, 2004 vintage -- upstream C source PLUS a reconstruction of
   EA's own edits to THIS file, inferred from retail's bytes.  Not pristine:
   see PROVENANCE.txt, "What differs from upstream", which lists every such
   file and what changed.  Each changed site is also marked in place.
   Sourced from the Area 51 (Inevitable Entertainment / Midway) source release,
   github.com/bisc67/Area51, Support/NetworkMgr/GameSpy -- the only public
   carrier found with the pre-2005 SDK layout (top-level nonport.c, no common/).
   Dated by nonport.h's own marker "Added by Saad Nader on 08-02-2004".
   That vintage is not assumed, it is measured: against lotrbfme.exe this tree
   scores 440 byte-exact whole functions where the 2007 SDK (nitrocaster/GameSpy,
   GS_Aluigi) scores 51 and 48 on the same TUs.
   Retail linked the DLL CRT, so libc calls are __imp__ indirect -- /MD is what
   makes those call sites byte-exact -- and built the SDK __cdecl: /Gz collapses
   the qr2+GP+ghttp core from 108 exact hits to 6.
   Win32 headers come from reference/shims/gamespy (see its windows.h): the
   toolchain ships no PlatformSDK, and the sweep shim next door is C++-only.

   This TU (ghttpCallbacks.c) is not present in the Area51 carrier tree -- the
   three ghiCall*Callback() trampolines are declared in ghttpCallbacks.h but
   were never checked in as a standalone .c anywhere upstream that has been
   found. ghiCallProgressCallback is reconstructed from the retail
   disassembly at 0x0087B610 (connection->progressCallback dispatch, matching
   the ghttpProgressCallback typedef in ghttp.h field-for-field).
   ghiCallCompletedCallback is reconstructed from the retail disassembly at
   0x0087B5B0: only for GHIGET requests does it pass the getFileBuffer.data
   pointer and fileBytesReceived through to the callback (all other request
   types pass NULL/0, matching the ghttp.h contract that buffer is "only
   valid if ghttpGetFile[Ex] was used"); if a buffer was passed and the
   callback returns GHTTPFalse, getFileBuffer.dontFree is set per the
   documented "return false if the app will free the buffer" contract.
   ghiCallPostCallback is reconstructed from the retail disassembly at
   0x0087B660: it calls postingState.callback with (request, bytesPosted,
   totalBytes, index, ArrayLength(states), connection->callbackParam) --
   matching the ghttpPostCallback typedef's (request, bytesPosted,
   totalBytes, objectsPosted, totalObjects, param) field-for-field, with
   postingState.index doing double duty as "objects posted so far" and
   ArrayLength(postingState.states) as "total objects". */
