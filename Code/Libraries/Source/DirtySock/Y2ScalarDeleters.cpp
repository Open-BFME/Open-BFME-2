// Open-BFME5: eighteen scalar deleting destructors from the DirtySock slice,
// in two shapes.
//
// `??_G` is not written, it is GENERATED: MSVC emits one per class with a
// virtual destructor, and it is the function the vtable's destructor slot
// actually points at.  Its body is always the same three steps -- run the
// destructor, test bit 0 of the hidden flag argument, free only if it is set
// -- and the `push <SIZE> / push this / call / add esp,8` says the class
// declares the C++98 MEMBER `operator delete(void *, size_t)`, because the
// global one-argument form takes no size.  The size in the instruction stream
// IS the class's size, which is where each `m_bfmePad` below comes from.
//
// SHAPE ONE (nine bodies) calls a destructor out of line and nothing else, so
// the class's own destructor is out of line; each has its own.
//
// SHAPE TWO (nine bodies) stores a vptr and then calls a SHARED destructor at
// 0x007EB6C0.  That is a derived class whose own destructor is INLINE and
// empty: what survives inlining is the vptr restore the compiler emits at the
// head of every destructor, followed by the base's.  Eight of the nine are
// 0xC bytes and one is 0x70, but all nine share the base, so the base is one
// class and only the vtables tell them apart.
//
// GETTING MSVC TO EMIT `??_G` AT ALL takes a defined constructor: the vtable
// is emitted only where something instantiates the class, and `??_G` rides
// along with it.  Declaring the destructor is not enough, and neither is an
// extra inline virtual -- both were tried and emit nothing.  Those eighteen
// constructors are the price of the recipe; retail has them somewhere and
// this file does not know where, so each is marked present-unmatched rather
// than claimed.
//
// IDENTITY IS NOT RECOVERED.  Classes are named for their `??_G` address, the
// padding carries the size the delete call names, and the shared base is
// named for its destructor.

struct BfmeDirtyBase
{
	BfmeDirtyBase();
	virtual ~BfmeDirtyBase();		// retail 0x007EB6C0

// This constructor forces MSVC to emit the base's vtable and its generated
// scalar deleting destructor; the retail scalar body at 0x007E9060 calls the
// shared base destructor at 0x007EB6C0 and the global operator delete.
