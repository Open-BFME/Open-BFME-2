 * lock sits at +0x1F4 where theirs are at +0x1EC and +0x1E8, and its object is

 *
 * WHAT THE OBJECT IS.  Its first fourteen words are a table of FUNCTION
 * POINTERS, filled in one by one, and the first two entries are this file's
 * own two bodies -- construct at +0x00 and destroy at +0x04.  That is
 * DirtySock's usual shape for a transport: a plain C struct whose leading
 * fields are the operations, so a caller holds one pointer and reaches
 * everything through it.  The other twelve land in the address range
 * commudp.cpp already occupies, which is what places this pair.
 *
 * The remaining pointer operands are declared address-derived and asserted to
 * be nothing more: they are DIR32 sites, so the gate fills them from retail
 * and the names below never reach the bytes.

 * rather than by comparing against the base, is what makes it wrap correctly
 * at the start of the ring.  So a stalled connection retransmits its most
 * recent packet rather than its oldest, which is the one an ack would be
 * answering.
 *
 * Otherwise it sends a bare message carrying its own sequence and the peer's
 * progress: code gets the send sequence, value gets the reported receive
 * sequence minus one.  The minus one is the same convention the ack handler
 * decodes -- "I want this next" rather than "I have this".
 *
 * The kind word is written LAST, after the two fields it describes, which is
 * retail's order and not the one a reader would write.

 * not idle, destroyed if a shared one is found, destroyed if the bind fails,
 * adopted otherwise.  There is no path that hands it back.

 * A FAILED BIND LEAVES THE STATE AT 0, which is not one of the five values any
 * other body uses -- 1 through 5 are the live ones.  So 0 means "construction
 * got as far as binding and failed", a state the object cannot otherwise
 * reach, and nothing here moves it out again.

/* 0x008187E0 ACCEPTS A RECEIVED RECORD into the receive queue, and it is where
 * the sequence discipline actually lives.
 *
 * A FULL QUEUE IS DETECTED BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE, by advancing the write cursor
 * one record and seeing whether it would land on the read cursor -- so one
 * record's worth of the ring is always left empty and the two cursors never
 * mean "full" and "empty" at the same time.
 *
 * CODE 6 IS UNSEQUENCED and takes a different path: rather than being checked
 * against the expected sequence it is admitted only while more than four
 * records are free, so a flood of them cannot fill the queue and starve
 * sequenced traffic.  It also does not advance the sequence or the byte
 * counter on the way in.
 *
 * Everything else is sequenced, and the three outcomes are the protocol:
 *   - BELOW the expected sequence is a duplicate and is dropped silently;
 *   - ABOVE it means something was missed, and the incoming record is
 *     REWRITTEN IN PLACE into a code-4 retransmit request naming the sequence
 *     actually wanted and sent straight back.  Reusing the caller's buffer
 *     rather than building a message is why this returns -1: the record it was
 *     handed no longer holds what arrived.
 *   - equal, but empty, is a pure acknowledgement and is dropped.
 *
 * The callback is invoked with the payload from +0x10, and the depth counter
 * is raised before the copy and lowered after the callback returns -- so it
 * spans the one window in which a caller could re-enter.
