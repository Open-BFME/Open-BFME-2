 * module and the file name is address-derived like the symbols.
 *
 * WHAT THE FIELDS ARE, read from the arithmetic rather than assumed.  The two
 * bodies together use +0xB0, +0xB4, +0xB8 and +0xBC as a ring: an offset is
 * advanced by +0xB0 and reduced modulo +0xB4, so +0xB0 is a RECORD SIZE and
 * +0xB4 the buffer size in bytes; the backlog is computed as the distance from
 * +0xBC to +0xB8 taken modulo the buffer size and then DIVIDED BY THE RECORD
 * SIZE, which is what makes the result a count of records rather than bytes.
 * +0xBC is therefore the read cursor and +0xB8 the write cursor.  All the

/* 0x00816520 DEQUEUES ONE RECEIVED RECORD.
 *
 * It pumps the transport first, but ONLY IF THE QUEUE LOOKS EMPTY -- and then
 * re-tests, so a pump that produced nothing still returns -7 rather than
 * reading a stale slot.  That double test is not redundant: the pump is what
 * fills the queue.
 *
 * The length it reports is the stored record length MINUS ONE, the inverse of
 * the plus-one the send applies, and the payload it copies starts at +9 rather
 * than +8 -- both skip the same one-byte header.
 *
 * THE COPY IS CLAMPED BUT THE RETURN IS NOT.  A caller passing a buffer
 * smaller than the record gets a truncated copy and the FULL length back, so
 * the return value is "how big it was", not "how much you got"; comparing them
 * is the only way to detect truncation.  Nothing here reports it otherwise.
 *
 * The optional out-parameter receives the record's +0x00 word.  In the send
 * queue that field is the retransmit stamp; here it is the arrival stamp the
 * receive path wrote.  Same offset, different meaning per queue.
