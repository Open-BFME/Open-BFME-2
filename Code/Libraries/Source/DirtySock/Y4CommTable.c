/* ProtoAdvt's socket callback, BFME2 RVA 0x0067E590, 1507 code bytes
 * plus 81 bytes of matching compiler stack-check descriptors and names.
 * Starting source: BFME1 bank at 34f59164f6d1efd413c5fd37f4894ec834c3c0fe,
 * targets/game/reverse/attempts/0x00812690.cpp (not a matched donor).
 * Madden NFL 07 PS3's named _ProtoAdvtCallback in DirtySDK
 * 4.7.3-custom-090 supplied the semantic cross-check; all control flow,
 * offsets, constants and helper targets below are established from BFME2.
 * The original address-bound symbol is retained for existing callers.
 *
 * Recheck the socket each receive iteration. Empty receives leave the loop;
 * expiry, cancellation and retransmission still run afterwards. Entries
 * expire when their address text is empty, deadline is zero, or now exceeds
 * the deadline. Cancellation clears the outgoing address text before send.
 * See docs/reconstruction/protoadvt-callback.json for the donor differences.
