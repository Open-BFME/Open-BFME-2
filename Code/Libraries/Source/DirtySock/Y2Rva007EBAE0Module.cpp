// 0x007ED470 SERIALISES A BINARY BUFFER INTO A FIELD UNDER A FORMAT STRING.

// a tiny interpreter over the data, emitting comma-separated values.
//
// THE DIRECTIVES ARE 'a' 'b' 'w' 'l' 's', optionally preceded by a decimal
// count, with '#' introducing a comment run and '*' meaning REPEAT.  The
// repeat works by stepping the format pointer BACK one, so the previous
// directive runs again on the next pass -- it is bounded by the DATA, not by
// the format, and a format ending in '*' consumes the buffer to its end.
//
// A NEGATIVE LENGTH MEANS 64K, not "unbounded" and not an error, so a caller
// who does not know the size gets a fixed ceiling rather than a refusal.
//
// NUMBERS ARE RIGHT-ALIGNED IN A FIXED NIBBLE FIELD AND THEN CLOSED UP, which
// is what the terminator-at-the-top and the copy-down are for.  THE EXACT-FIT
// CASE SKIPS THE SEPARATOR: when a value uses every nibble of its width the
// digits are already in place, the pointer is simply advanced, and the comma
// that every other path appends is never written.  A full-width value is
// therefore run together with whatever follows it.
//
// THE NEGATIVE TEST IS A MAGNITUDE TEST, not a sign bit.  Only values above
// 0xFFFF0000 print with a minus, so a 32-bit value that is negative as an int
// but smaller in magnitude than 65536 prints as a large positive number.  That
// is consistent for the 'w' and 'b' widths, which cannot reach the threshold
// at all, and inconsistent for 'l'.
//
// STRINGS ARE ESCAPED THROUGH THE CHARACTER-CLASS TABLE, the same one the
// field matcher uses, so what counts as safe here is defined by the record
// syntax rather than by this function.
//
// TRAILING SEPARATORS ARE STRIPPED IN A LOOP at the end, which is the only
// thing that keeps a format whose last directive produced nothing from leaving

// 0x007EE150 COPIES ONE FIELD FROM ANOTHER RECORD, name and all.  It finds the
// value with the backwards matcher, walks back over the name to the start of
// the whole "name=value" run, and hands that to the replace-or-append engine.
//
// IT LANDS HERE RATHER THAN BESIDE THE ENGINE because it calls the matcher,
// which is C++-mangled in this file and cannot be named from the C half of the
// module.  That is the same seam that put the two field formatters here, and
// it is a fact about how two lanes reconstructed one translation unit rather
// than anything retail did.
//
// THE RECORD BUILDER'S 'x' DIRECTIVE DOES THE SAME JOB DIFFERENTLY, and the
// difference is worth stating because both are now converted: that one backs
// the pointer up by exactly ONE byte and lets the engine rescan for a
// delimiter, where this walks the whole name.  Two callers of one matcher,
// two conventions for what to hand on, and neither is documented anywhere but
// in the bytes.
//
// A MISSING FIELD RETURNS 0, NOT -1 -- the same value a successful no-op
// returns from the engine -- so a caller cannot distinguish "no such field in
// the source" from "the destination already held this".
