// The element type here is a STAND-IN. What the image fixes is the element
// SIZE - it is the stride in every loop and the shift in every distance - and
// a byte-exact body says only that the real element is a POD of that size.
// BfmeE8, BfmeE12 and BfmeE16 name that size and claim nothing more. The
// bodies are byte-exact; the mangled names carry a placeholder where the real
// instantiation's type belongs, and should be repointed if that type is ever
// identified from a call site.
