"""Group unclaimed retail bodies into families that ONE conversion can pay for.

A family is a set of addresses whose bodies are the same function differing
only in constants. Converting one member proves the shape; the rest land in a
single add_match_batch pass. The whole question is what "the same" means, and
this tool offers four progressively looser normal forms:

  --exact   raw bytes. Finds only families with no relocations and no varying
            field at all.

  --disp    REL32 branch displacements zeroed. A call to a FIXED target encodes
            a DIFFERENT displacement from every address, so exact grouping
            structurally cannot see relocation-bearing families -- every member
            is its own singleton. When this was first measured, on a much
            earlier ledger, masking took the queue from 11 families and 51 rows
            to 161 families and 1,614 rows.

  --operand (default) every immediate AND displacement field zeroed, using
            capstone byte offsets so opcodes, modrm register selection and
            instruction lengths stay intact. `sub ecx,0x58` and `sub ecx,0x08`
            are one shape with one varying axis, but they are not byte-identical
            and --disp leaves each a singleton -- masking displacements does not
            mask IMMEDIATES.

  --mnemonic  the mnemonic sequence alone; operands, REGISTERS and instruction
            lengths all discarded. Merges families that --operand splits purely
            on which register the allocator picked, which is a difference the
            source usually does not contain.

Measured at 31cb443bf over the 7,183 bodies then passing the filters below:

              mode        families    rows    remaining singletons
              --exact          162     348                   6,731
              --disp           384   1,017                   6,062
              --operand        727   3,280                   3,799

and at 35930fea2, once --operand had been worked down to a flat queue whose
largest family held 13 members, --mnemonic restored a workable head (60, 35,
24, 23, 22 ...): 1,481 rows against 869 at --min-members 3.

Looser grouping trades precision for reach and WILL produce false families. An
immediate can be load-bearing in the source -- a 0 and a 1 need different C++ --
and under --mnemonic two members may differ in source outright, since `mov/mov/
ret` says almost nothing. That is acceptable and not a defect, but the looser
the mode the less a proven member says about its siblings: treat a --mnemonic
family as a HYPOTHESIS to look at, never as a claim. This decides only what is
worth LOOKING at; the byte gate still decides every member individually.

FILTERS, each of which exists because omitting it cost a run:
  * only unclaimed Code/gen_asm/ dump rows -- gen_small and gen_uw own theirs;
  * drop rows whose address carries a REAL (not address-derived) symbols.csv
    pin: those are tgrid territory;
  * drop ghidra=Unwind@ rows: compiler unwind residue, not function bodies;
  * require the byte AFTER the row to be 0xCC, so a PREFIX of a longer function
    cannot pass as a whole one;
  * require the body to end in a ret or a jmp, which excludes padding-terminated
    dead code;
  * EXCLUDE PREVIOUSLY-ATTEMPTED ADDRESSES ONLY AFTER GROUPING. Excluding them
    first splits a partially-attempted family into two apparently distinct
    groups -- that is exactly how 0x001EEAE0 and 0x001F35C0 were reported as
    two families of 6 and 7 when they were one family of 7;
  * drop a whole family if any member carries a `refuted` or `blocked` verdict:
    a refutation refutes the SHAPE, so the siblings are dead too;
  * drop bodies that call _atexit -- their source needs a function-local static
    of class type, and MSVC numbers those destructor helpers `_$E<n>` PER
    TRANSLATION UNIT, so the second such TU in the image always collides with
    the first on a name-global consistency check. See
    registers_a_local_static(); it has cost three landings so far.
