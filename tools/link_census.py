"""Link every matched object into one image and count what stops it.

Every other gate verifies one function at a time. Nothing had ever linked the
tree, so nobody knew how far "the functions match" is from "the game builds".
This links the object of every matched ledger row (compiled TUs, MASM dumps,
generated C++, prebuilt-library members), in retail's link order (link_order),
with MSVC 7.1's own link.exe under
/FORCE, so it reports every problem instead of stopping at the first, and sorts
them into the classes the integration work has to clear:

  unresolved   a referenced name nothing defines
    data         a global the code reaches by a pinned address
                 (dir32_addresses.csv): needs a definition
    import       __imp__ DLL entry: needs the import libraries
    alias        a pinned call name whose address is matched under another
                 name: collapse onto the defining name
    dump         a pinned call name whose address is still a dump: the dump
                 defines ?d_XXXXXXXX, so it needs the real name
    unpinned     referenced but pinned nowhere (runtime, shims, typos)
    vtable/rtti  ??_7 / ??_R: a class's vftable or type info
  duplicate    a name defined by two objects (private class copies, shims,
               double conversions)

  python3 tools/link_census.py            # link, write build/link_census/census.json
  python3 tools/link_census.py --build --history   # compile what changed first (all cores), then census
  python3 tools/link_census.py --report   # summarise the last census
  python3 tools/link_census.py --status   # redo link_status.csv + LINKED from the last log
  python3 tools/link_census.py --selected # which COMDAT copy the link selected (/MAP), vs retail truth

`--history` records the census in link_census_history.csv, with LINKED
(linked_bytes) measured on this tree, and writes
reverse/link_status.csv: one row per C/C++
source, `linked=yes` when, in the plain link (no alias scaffold), its object
has no unresolved reference beyond imports and msvcrt.lib, no duplicate, and
no COMDAT copy that differs from retail's body (comdat_losers), no name it
defines or references resolves in the link to a kept definition proven not
retail's (wrong_selected; the /MAP of a second link says which it kept), and
the file holds no hard-coded image address. LINKED is progress.py's DECOMPILED restricted to
those sources; progress.py and the README print the last census's figure.

These are Open-BFME-1's rules (its tools/link_census.py), ported function for
function so the two projects measure LINKING the same way; only paths and the
retail-truth inputs this repository lacks differ (no data_rows.csv, no
dir32_addresses.csv, no route= pins: see data_ledger, _dir32_rows and
validated_import_routes; a data_rows.csv refuses the census until its rules
are ported). Before the port this census kept the COMDAT copy most objects
compiled, exempted STLport and the array helpers, linked in ledger row order
and had no wrong_selected: link_census_history.csv names the rules every row
was measured under (`rules`, `prev_rules`; see HISTORY_FIELDS), and
tools/census_rebaseline.py records the one row where they change.

An object counts only when it is proven current, as Open-BFME-1 proves it:
a census-grade compile receipt (build.compile_is_current(strict=True): the
source, compile command, every included header and the listing of every
include search directory unchanged) or, for a TU whose sidecar cannot carry
that, this run's own witnessed compile (census_receipts.py). The objects, the
compiler inputs and these tools must then hold still from the first check
to the record (census_state); otherwise nothing is recorded.

The census is diagnostic. The image it writes is not expected to run.

    """Is a COMDAT copy the body retail shipped?

    A COMDAT symbol whose ledger row (functions.csv, else a symbols.csv pin)
    gives a retail address is judged against retail itself: its bytes must
    equal retail's at that address outside the relocation fields, and every
    relocation must land where retail's instruction lands. A relocation's
    target NAME is resolved the way an identity is, not the way the byte gate
    resolves a call: a ledger row first (never an icf-owner= over-claim:
    __purecall's row sits on one of many `xor eax,eax; ret` bodies), and a
    symbols.csv pin only for a name with no row (plus its numeric route=), because
    symbols.csv is an ADDITIVE candidate list and a pin on the wrong body
    still byte-matches. That is exactly how
    ??1AsciiString@@QAE@XZ's owner copy passed the gate: retail 0x5EE90 is
    `jmp 0x887940` (releaseBuffer), the owner's copy jumps to
    ??1?$StringBase@D@@AAE@XZ, whose row is 0x5E490, and a pin of that name to
    0x887940 hid the difference. Data names resolve through
    dir32_addresses.csv, __imp_ names to retail's import slot, and a label in
    the copy's own section to the same offset in retail. An incremental-link
    stub (a `jmp` packed between other `jmp`s) stands for its target on either
    side; a padded 5-byte `jmp` is a function that tail-jumps (0x5E490 is
    ~StringBase's own body, not a stub) and is never followed. symbols.csv
    holds VAs and RVAs alike, so a pin at or above the image base is read both
    ways. A TU-local referent (a static, `_$E2`, `$S1`) is named per TU, so it
    has no address to check; a string literal or float constant (`??_C@`,
    `__real@`) is named by its content and retail holds several copies of
    some ("" at least twice), so it is checked by content: retail's bytes at
    the target must be the constant's own. Additional FF 25 import routes
    independently verified by pin_consistency may match REL32 calls, but
    never supply body homes or data-pointer targets.

    An address several ledger names claim (0x5E6F0 for ??8 of eight
    VectorClass instances in Open-BFME-1) proves nothing when it disagrees:
    one body has one identity, so most of those claims are wrong (or folded),
    and the mismatch is the ledger's.

    verdict() returns "retail" (every byte and relocation proven), "wrong"
    (a byte or a resolvable relocation differs from a single-claim address),
    "unknown" (nothing disproves it, but a relocation names something with no
    known address, or only a shared claim disagrees) or None (the symbol
    itself has no retail address: retail truth cannot judge it).

    its object (comdat_losers: retail truth where the symbol has a retail
    address, else the copy link.exe keeps, the first in link order). Any hard-coded image address counts too
