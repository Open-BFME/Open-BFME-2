"""Refuse queue addresses that cannot be a retail function boundary.

The structural queue's addresses come from an alignment vote, so a large share
of them name a spot a few bytes inside a body rather than its start. Nothing in
the queue told a worker that, so the fleet proved it by hand: ~2,300 logged
no-match rows, most of them a 30-60 minute reconstruction against an address
that never had a function at it.

Every check here rejects on positive evidence only -- a byte the image says is
padding, another function's start inside the claimed range, a stack cleanup the
body contradicts. Absence of evidence never rejects: 61% of the bodies already
landed are missing from the Ghidra inventory, so "not in the inventory" is
unknown, not wrong.

Two things deliberately do NOT reject. A range that stops short of the body's
end is a size error, and reconciling size drift is the tier's whole job -- it
warns and is still served. A body that ends in something other than a `ret` is
a tail call as often as it is a boundary error, so it is not consulted at all.

The image reader and the Ghidra inventory are injected rather than imported, so
a replay over a recorded queue is pure.
