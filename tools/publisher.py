"""The publisher: the only writer of the target branch; it writes receipted tips.

WHY. Open-BFME-1's tools/landing_service.py batches, bisects and recovers
exact tips, but (audit 2026-10, sol61): its default gate runs the CANDIDATE's own
.githooks/pre-push, so a unit that weakens the hook approves itself; a unit's
`verify` command runs with the service's environment and credentials; the
drainer sleeps ten minutes after every pass (67-120 commits/h against BFME2
peaks of 271/h); and worker identity is whatever the worker wrote. This file
replaces it. It imports nothing from the repository it serves, so BFME2
copies it unchanged; everything repository-specific is in the state's
config.json.

PIECES.
  CHECKER    A pinned bundle: the files under `checker_paths` (tools/,
             .githooks/, build scripts) at one PROMOTED commit, extracted to
             state/checkers/<digest>/ and re-hashed before every use. The
             candidate's own copies never run: the builder overlays the
             bundle onto the candidate worktree and marks the overlaid paths
             skip-worktree, so `git diff`/`status` inside the gate still see
             the candidate's tree. `promote` is the only way to change the
             bundle: every exploit fixture must get its expected verdict, and
             the full-ledger output (`ledger_cmd`) of the old and new bundle
             on the current head must agree, or each differing line must be
             listed in --accept-diff.
  BUILDER    `build` is its own process with a scrubbed environment (no
             tokens, no credential helper, no global/system git config, HOME
             in its scratch dir), in a clone with NO remote that borrows the
             publisher's objects (--shared). It runs the configured gate with
             the pinned checker and writes a receipt: tip, base, tip tree,
             checker digest, toolchain hashes, verdict, log hash, signed with
             HMAC-SHA256 (state/receipt.key). A unit cannot bring a command:
             a check a unit needs belongs in the checker.
  PUBLISHER  Fast-forwards the branch (never forces) only to a tip whose
             receipt verifies, is green, names the current checker and names
             EXACTLY the current head as base. Batches are speculative: with N
             builders, batch k is composed on batch k-1's tip and gated at the
             same time. A red batch splits in halves (bisect); batches stacked
             on it go back to the queue. Composition is deterministic (fixed
             committer, committer date = author date), so the same units on
             the same base give the same tip SHA: after a crash its receipt is
             reused and nothing is re-gated. A publication is journalled; on
             start, a journalled tip already on the branch settles as landed.
             The drainer never sleeps after a batch; it waits at most
             `poll_seconds` for a builder or a submission.
  FAIRNESS   An operator is the key that signed the submission (config
             `operators`), never the commit author. Each has a token bucket
             (`rate` units/h, `burst`). A batch takes reserved `infra_slots`
             for infrastructure units, then round-robin from operators
             holding tokens, then fills leftover room (work-conserving) except
             from operators in the slow lane (more than `red_slow_lane` of
             their last 20 gated units red). Units sharing a `bundle` land or
             fail together; `after` orders a unit behind others. Waiting
             raises priority by one per `aging_minutes`, and a prerequisite
             inherits the priority of everything waiting on it, so zero-credit
             prerequisite work is not starved. A `wide` unit is gated alone.
  SCOPE      Every unit declares the path globs it may touch (`scope.allow`,
             optional `scope.forbid`; `**` crosses directories). No path is
             exempt: shared ledgers (functions.csv, symbols.csv,
             data_rows.csv, baselines), headers, build files, tools/ and
             .githooks/ are scope like any other. Two units whose scopes
             overlap (a path one touches is inside the other's scope, or the
             same glob) are never in flight together: the later one waits,
             it is not rejected. Row ledgers (`row_ledgers`: functions.csv
             by target_rva, symbols.csv by name, data_rows.csv by address,
             other union-merged ledgers by whole line) are scoped by row:
             `targets/game/reverse/functions.csv#0x00401000` allows and
             overlaps that row only; a plain path allows the whole file.
             A unit's rows are read from its diff with the ledger's header.
             A unit touching a file that others #include (by file name,
             transitively, as header_dependents.py does; `#include MACRO`
             counts as including everything) also overlaps every unit that
             touches one of those includers. After the rebase each unit's own diff must
             stay inside its scope, or it is rejected with the offending
             paths (`out-of-scope`).
  RETRIES    A gate-red unit is fingerprinted: its +/- lines outside
             `ledger_paths` plus its target (its non-ledger scope globs).
             After `retry_limit` (3) equivalent failures for one target, an
             equivalent submission is refused (`retry-limit`) until the
             target's inputs change: the blobs its scope covers at the head,
             or the promoted checker.
  SUBMIT     Operators call `submit` instead of `git push`: the range becomes
             a format-patch unit plus an envelope signed with the operator's
             key, written to an inbox directory or pushed to
             refs/submit/<operator>/<id> on a submission remote.
             tools/publisher_pre_push.sh turns a push to master into a submit.
  METRICS    state/events.jsonl; `status` prints queue depth per operator,
             oldest wait, landed in the last hour, latency p50/p95, builders.

LIMITS. Builders run as the publisher's OS user unless config
`builder_prefix` runs them as another (e.g. ["sudo", "-u", "builder"]): env
scrubbing keeps tokens out of the gate, only a separate user keeps the
receipt key and the OS credential store out of reach. Only an admin ruleset
restricting the branch to the bot stops a direct or API push; the publisher
detects one (event `foreign_push`) and re-bases its pipeline. Runbook:
docs/publisher.md.
