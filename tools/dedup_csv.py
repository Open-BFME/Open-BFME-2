"""Normalize reverse/functions.csv and reverse/symbols.csv after a union merge.

Many agents append rows concurrently and push straight to main; the union merge
driver combines both sides, which can leave the ledger unsorted or holding two
rows for one (address, name). This collapses each (address, name) pair to a
single row and re-sorts, deterministically, so any agent can run it and get the
identical result. Distinct names at one address are ICF alias groups and are
kept.

functions.csv: one row per (target_rva, name) — ICF alias groups legitimately
hold several names at one address (folded identical COMDATs), so the name is part
of the key. A matched row beats an unmatched one; among equals the smaller
target_size wins (a trimmed-padding row). If rows still tie but name DIFFERENT
sources, only byte-verification can say which source really defines the symbol,
so this refuses to guess and exits 1 naming both. (It used to break that tie on
the lexically first source, which silently repointed findFieldParse at ini.cpp
after it had moved to ini_parsers.cpp — the row then referenced a file that no
longer defined it, and the full gate died with "symbol not found in object".)
symbols.csv: unique (name,address) lines. Run with no arguments; edits in place.
