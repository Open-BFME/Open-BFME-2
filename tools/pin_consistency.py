"""Pin-consistency guard for reverse/symbols.csv.

symbols.csv is an ADDITIVE candidate list. build.py's REL32 resolver walks a
name's addresses in file order and keeps the first displacement that reproduces
retail (see load_symbol_map / compile_function). Give one name enough addresses
and something will match, so a green gate proves the BYTES of the caller and
says nothing about WHICH function the callee is. Three misidentifications
reached master through exactly that hole:

  * findNonConstCommandButton was pinned at both 0x36D27 and 0x44EEF, whose
    thunks follow to different 126-byte bodies. A shim had moved two struct
    fields so one class would fit the wrong one; the result byte-matched and was
    written up as an exact match (retracted in a16b62ec9).
  * 0x14867 is currently pinned as winSetDisabledColor, winSetEnabledColor,
    winSetEnabledBorderColor AND winSetHiliteColor at once, which is how sixteen
    GameWindow/GadgetSlider rows came to sit one body early (ba1dbf6f8).

THE INVARIANT: every address pinned to one name must, after following the
incremental-link thunk chain, land on a body byte-equal to every other body the
same name pins. One name, one function.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH -- read this before trusting a green line
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The invariant is ONE NAME, MANY ADDRESSES. Two neighbouring hazards are shaped
the other way round and are outside it. Neither is a bug in the check; both are
uncovered ground, and saying so here is the point.

1. ONE ADDRESS, MANY NAMES. The 0x14867 incident above is really this shape.
   Three of its four names are flagged only incidentally, because they happen to
   carry other pins too; ?winSetEnabledBorderColor@GameWindow@@QAEHHH@Z pins
   0x14867 and nothing else and is completely invisible here. 70,144 of 70,633
   symbols pin exactly one address and are never compared to anything. A blanket
   check is not the answer -- 6,601 bodies legitimately carry several names, one
   of them 453 folded destructors -- but nothing checks the illegitimate ones.

2. THE OTHER HALF OF THE CANDIDATE LIST. load_symbol_map seeds each name from
   its functions.csv rows and THEN appends its symbols.csv pins, so the additive
   list the resolver actually walks is the union of both. This guard reads only
   the pins. A name with one pin and one ledger row pointing at a different body
   is a two-candidate list -- the exact hazard -- and `len(pins) < 2` skips it.
   `--candidates` applies the same invariant to the real list and currently
   finds 114 violations on top of the gated 410. It reports; it does not gate,
   because gating it would mean baselining 114 new lines and this file is only
   allowed to shrink. Drain them, do not record them.

HOW TEMPLATES ARE HANDLED (explicitly, not by exclusion)
--------------------------------------------------------
A template instantiated in K translation units leaves up to K byte-identical
COMDATs in retail, and pinning all K is legitimate -- those are the same
function. Two copies of one function at different RVAs differ ONLY in their
rel32 displacement slots, and there by exactly (rva_b - rva_a), because a
displacement is `target - (site + 4)` and the target is shared. So the
comparison rebases instead of excluding: bytes must be equal everywhere except
at rel32 slots anchored to a real branch opcode (E8/E9/0F 8x), where the two
little-endian displacements must differ by exactly the RVA delta.

That is strictly stronger than the blind masking compile_function does for a
lib member: blind masking would let two DIFFERENT call targets pass, the
rebasing test would not. No name pattern is consulted anywhere -- a `??$`
template and a hand-written function are judged by the same rule, and a folded
(ICF) body reached from two pins is one body and trivially consistent.

BASELINE, NOT WHITELIST
-----------------------
First run found a backlog of known-bad pins. reverse/pin_consistency_baseline.csv
records each one WITH its evidence so the guard fails on anything NEW while the
backlog is drained. It is deliberately not self-seeding: an absent baseline is a
hard failure with instructions, never an auto-written free pass, because
verify_dir32_consistency's self-bootstrap is how 18 whitelist entries (8 of them
provably-wrong placements) got written without a human ever reading them.

The key is (symbol, sorted body RVAs). Adding or removing a pin changes the key,
so a baselined symbol cannot quietly absorb a new bad address, and a FIXED
symbol leaves a stale line that also fails -- the fix and the line removal are
one commit. Shrinking this file is the only direction it is allowed to move.

        These are candidates, not verdicts. A previous session landed all 47 of
        them and the full gate turned 111 byte-matched rows RED; 110 of those
        failures resolved to a pin it had just dropped. Only 21 of 47 survived
        three gate rounds -- a ~55% false-verdict rate on output once labelled
        "settled by the ledger". The lesson is one rule:

            A BYTE-VERIFIED CALLER OUTRANKS A BYTE-VERIFIED IDENTITY ROW.

        A ledger row says what a body IS. A retail call site says what the
        resolver NEEDS. When they disagree the call site wins, because dropping
        that pin removes the only candidate that reproduces the caller's
        displacement and the gate goes red. The row has to move before the pin
        can follow it.

        THIS FUNCTION CANNOT APPLY THAT RULE, AND THE OBVIOUS FIX IS WRONG.
        Screening out pins retail calls was implemented and measured before
        being removed: 36 of the 39 pins that DID land clean in 0d42eb8f4 are
        themselves retail call targets, so the screen suppresses 92% of the good
        answers while catching 25 of 26 bad ones. It does not separate them, it
        just says "no". Obvious in hindsight -- a callee pin IS an address
        retail calls, so "is it called" is true of nearly all of them.

        Deciding it properly means knowing which SYMBOL each call site
        references, and that lives in the object files' relocations, not in the
        image. This module deliberately reads neither compile output nor cached
        artifacts -- 1.6s on the image and the ledgers is what lets the hooks
        afford it. So the contract is honest instead: these are CANDIDATES.
        Confirm each with a full ./build.sh, and expect about half to be
        refuted.

        Cheap to adjudicate means BOTH ends are already proven: exactly one
        pinned body carries a matched, identity-naming row for this very
        symbol, and every other pinned body carries one for a DIFFERENT
        function. Then the symbol's address is not in dispute and the other
        pins name somebody else's body -- retract them.

        A dropped body must have EXACTLY ONE identity owner, or be interior to a
        byte-verified body and therefore not an entry point at all. Several
        owners on one body is retail ICF: the linker folded functions that
        compiled to the same bytes, so "that address is somebody else" no longer
        argues the symbol is not also there, and the case needs a human.
        0x00887940 carries nine folded destructors and is why this bound exists.

        Anything less (a body only a generated or ?dup_ row covers, two bodies
        both claiming the symbol, no ledger identity anywhere) is a real
        investigation and is deliberately not offered here.

# PIN-CONSISTENCY BACKLOG -- a to-do list of known-wrong identities.
# Written by tools/pin_consistency.py; read by the full gate (tools/build.py).
# Generated file: do not reformat it, and see tools/pin_consistency.py for the
# full argument. THE GOAL IS AN EMPTY FILE.
#
# WHAT EACH LINE MEANS
# --------------------
# reverse/symbols.csv is an ADDITIVE candidate list: build.py's REL32 resolver
# walks a name's addresses and keeps the first displacement that reproduces
# retail. Give one name enough addresses and something matches, so a green gate
# proves the caller's BYTES and says nothing about WHICH function the callee is.
# Every line here is one name whose pinned addresses follow their thunk chains
# to bodies that are NOT the same function. At most one of them is that name.
# The rest are somebody else's function wearing its label, and each one is a
# misidentification waiting to be written up as an exact match -- which is
# exactly how the ControlBar and GameWindow families got 16 rows placed one body
# early before anyone noticed.
#
# WHY THEY ARE STILL HERE
# -----------------------
# Not because they are acceptable. The guard landed against a pre-existing
# backlog, and failing the gate on all of it would have blocked every agent
# from every unrelated commit. So the backlog is recorded WITH its evidence and
# the gate fails on anything NEW. A line here is a debt, never a permission slip.
#
# HOW TO RESOLVE ONE (this is the work; each line is a self-contained task)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   1. python3 tools/pin_consistency.py --symbol <name>
#        prints every pin, its thunk chain, each body's proven extent, and which
#        functions.csv rows already claim those bodies.
#   2. Decide WHICH body is the name. Evidence that settles it, strongest first:
#        a byte-verified functions.csv row naming this symbol at that body;
#        a ghidra xref/vtable slot; a decoded store offset (the GameWindow family
#        fell out of `lea eax,[eax+eax*2+d]` alone). Decompiled C is not proof.
#   3. Delete the losing pin rows from reverse/symbols.csv -- splice in place,
#        every surviving line byte-identical, terminators unchanged (uniform
#        CRLF), and verify the census before/after. Deleting is a rewrite.
#   4. Delete this line, in the SAME commit. A fixed symbol leaves a stale line
#        that fails too, on purpose: the fix and the removal are one change.
#   5. Run the FULL ./build.sh. Not the scoped one -- see the warning below.
#
# THE TRAP THAT CAUGHT THE LAST TWO SESSIONS
# ------------------------------------------
# A BYTE-VERIFIED CALLER OUTRANKS A BYTE-VERIFIED IDENTITY ROW. A session landed
# all 47 --clear-cut verdicts and the gate turned 111 byte-matched rows RED; 110
# of them resolved to a pin it had just deleted -- retail callers reaching the
# very body the ledger says belongs to somebody else. Only 21 of 47 survived.
# --clear-cut is a CANDIDATE list, not a verdict list: it reads the ledger and
# the image, never the object relocations that say which symbol a call site
# means, so it cannot see this coming. Screening out pins retail calls does NOT
# fix it -- that was measured, and it suppresses 36 of the 39 pins that landed
# clean. Confirm every retraction with a full ./build.sh; expect half to fail.
# When the ledger row and the call site disagree, the row moves first.
#
# THIS FILE IS ONLY ALLOWED TO SHRINK
# -----------------------------------
# Adding a line to make a build green is the exact anti-pattern this guard
# exists to stop -- fix the pin instead. Enforced, not merely requested:
# --write-baseline refuses to emit a key the file does not already carry, and
# `--assert-shrink-only` (run by .githooks/pre-commit) fails on any key added
# vs HEAD, so a hand-edited line is caught too. If you believe a line must be
# added, you have found a NEW misidentification: fix it.
#
# KEY AND COLUMNS
# ---------------
# key = symbol + its sorted body RVAs. A new address on a baselined symbol
# changes the key and FAILS, so a baselined line cannot quietly absorb one more
# bad pin.
#
# kinds:
#   divergent-bodies  same extent, bytes are not the same function even after
#                     rel32 rebasing -- at most one pin names this symbol
#   size-disagreement the pinned bodies have different proven extents. 307 of
#                     these are matched-vs-matched: two byte-verified bodies of
#                     different proven lengths cannot be one function.
#   no-boundary       a pinned body has no proven extent, so nothing can verify it
#   non-text-pin      a pin resolves outside .text and cannot be a code body
#
# evidence: <kind detail> :: <body><-<pins> owned-by:<other functions.csv names>
#           INTERIOR-OF:<fn>+0x<n> means the pin is not even an entry point --
#           it points inside a byte-verified body, so it cannot be any function.
#
# NOT COVERED HERE: single-pinned names, and the functions.csv half of the
# resolver's candidate list. `--candidates` reports the second (114 more).
