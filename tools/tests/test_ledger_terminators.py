"""reverse/symbols.csv has to carry ONE line terminator, and who enforces it.

symbols.csv is `merge=union` and its rows are pins that several tools legitimately
re-emit. A line differing from its twin only by a `\\r` is a DISTINCT line to the
union driver, so the same pin lands twice and every later merge compounds it --
that is how 4,172 pins became 8,784. functions.csv survives the same mixing
because a duplicated row trips check_csv's duplicate-name rule; a duplicated pin
is legal, so nothing downstream catches it.

`gen_small.line_terminator` already refuses to append to a mixed file, which
stops every wave. That is the right refusal in the wrong place: it fires hours
later, in a session that did not cause it. The three tools that WRITE the file
are tested here instead -- check_csv rejects the commit that mixes it, dedup_csv
(the repair tool) normalizes rather than flipping CRLF to LF wholesale, and
locate.py --emit appends in the file's own terminator.
