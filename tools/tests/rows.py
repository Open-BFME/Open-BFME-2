"""Declared outcomes for the LAN result-recording matrix.

One entry per row, written from the model of the engine *before* the row is run,
so tools/tests/test_game_records.py holds a measurement against a prediction
rather than against itself. the rig at dginovker/bfme-lan-rig reads the same dict; a row is spelled
here and nowhere else.

A measurement that contradicts its row is a finding about the engine. Change a
prediction only in a commit that states why the original model was wrong.
