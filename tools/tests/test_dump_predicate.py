"""One answer to "is this address still open work?", and a guard that keeps it.

A gen-dump row is retail's own bytes under a synthetic name: it fixes a boundary
and holds no source, so a work finder must treat the ground under it as open
while an over-claim guard must treat it as taken. Three tools decided that for
themselves and all three got it wrong; two of the fixes then keyed on the source
path, which still hides the 349 gen-dump rows that live in
Code/gen_small/dumps_000.cpp rather than Code/gen_asm/.

build.is_scaffold_row is the predicate and build.load_claim_rows serves the two
answers. The guard at the bottom is the point of the exercise: it fails the next
tool that decides dumpness from a path instead.
