"""The full gate must run every check, then exit once.

This is a regression lock on a defect that cost the pin guard its entire
existence. tools/pin_consistency.py landed wired into the full gate at
616cbfc3e and was reported as live. It never ran. verify_dir32_consistency sat
four statements ahead of it with a live red on master, raised SystemExit(1), and
the process died there -- so the check built specifically to catch what a green
gate cannot had itself never executed in that gate, on any commit.

Nothing detected this for two days because a first-failure exit is invisible
from the outside: "the gate is red on DIR32" reads exactly the same whether the
later checks passed or never ran at all. Ordering is not a safety property.
Running is. So the property under test is not "the pin guard comes first" -- it
is "a red check cannot silence the checks behind it", which holds no matter how
anyone reorders main() later.
