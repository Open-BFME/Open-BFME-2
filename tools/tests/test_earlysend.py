"""Build the early-send fix and check it changed only what it claims to.

The constraint on this feature is not "does it work" -- the spike measures that
-- it is that it must not alter the pace of the game. The engine welds those
together: game time per logic frame is a compiled-in constant, so touching the
5 Hz quantum multiplies the speed of the game, and that is the failure this
project has been burned by before. So the assertions here are mechanical rather
than behavioural:

  * the quantum, the frame-ceiling writers and GameLogic's own cadence are
    byte-identical to retail in the built image;
  * outside the appended cave, the ONLY bytes that differ from retail are the
    detour sites the build printed. A fix that is surgical in the source and
    broad in the image is broad;
  * the payload tail-calls the retail pump with the engine's own three guards,
    so it can only make an existing mechanism run more often.
