"""The pin-consistency guard: one name, one function.

reverse/symbols.csv is an additive candidate list, so a wrong pin does not fail
anything by itself -- it waits for a call site whose displacement it happens to
reproduce and then lends its address to a body that is not the function. The
mistakes this file pins down are the ones that still look like they worked:

  * comparing two copies of one function WITHOUT rebasing their rel32 slots
    reports every template instantiation as a violation, which floods the
    backlog and gets the guard turned off;
  * forgiving any four bytes that differ by the RVA delta, without demanding a
    branch opcode in front of them, silently accepts two DIFFERENT functions;
  * stopping the thunk walk after one hop compares two jump stubs instead of
    two bodies -- 1,915 pinned addresses reach their body through two or more;
  * a baseline that admits new lines is a whitelist, and this repo has already
    been bitten by one.
