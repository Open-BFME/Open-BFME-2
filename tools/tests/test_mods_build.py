"""Build the real overlay and check the emitted code; needs MSVC 7.1 + capstone.

test_cave.py covers the cave mechanics with synthetic payloads. This covers the
feature itself, where the source reads correctly and only the emitted bytes give
it away. Every assertion below is a bug that actually shipped into a build:

  * the payload's exit fell straight into the helper functions emitted after it,
    because modbuild appends the relocated prologue after the WHOLE blob. The
    shim cave.py now generates cannot do that -- there is nothing after it but
    the prologue -- so what is asserted is the shape that makes it impossible;
  * fputs(str, FILE*) takes the string first, unlike fprintf(FILE*, fmt, ...).
    Copying fprintf's push order handed the FILE* over as the string and the
    game raised EXCEPTION_INVALID_HANDLE mid-match;
  * the leave payload's gate. The leave entry it hooks fires on a departure from
    a finished match as well as on a quit, so the gate has to be
    VictoryConditions' end frame. Anything that only says "a match was in
    progress" -- a started latch, or the network status, which is still 1 on the
    score screen -- reads correctly in the source and appends a spurious `leave`
    line to the file of every player who finishes a match;
  * `--probe` passed doing nothing after a rewrite dropped its guard. A flag
    with no assertion behind it looks like a working one.

Since the payloads became C++, two more things are worth holding: the record
formats, which downstream data is keyed on, and the absence of any runtime
library -- there is no CRT behind this code, so a compiler-emitted `_memset` or
`__chkstk` is an unresolvable symbol rather than a helper.
