"""Replay the boundary validator over recorded queues; stdlib + pytest.

Two numbers only mean anything together, and both are asserted here: how much of
the fleet's recorded waste this refuses, and how much proven-correct work it
refuses along with it. A filter that rejects everything scores perfectly on the
first and is worthless.

The two populations are committed under fixtures/ instead of being rebuilt from
the live queue, because the live queue changes every few minutes as the fleet
lands rows, and a measurement whose population moves under you is not a
measurement. The Ghidra inventory is read at a pinned commit for the same
reason -- the retail image never changes, but the fleet keeps extending the
inventory. Both fixtures were cut from the queue and the dead-end log as they
stood at that commit; regenerate them with tools/tests/fixtures/README.md.
