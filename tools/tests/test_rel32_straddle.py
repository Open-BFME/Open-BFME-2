"""A REL32 site cannot straddle a row's end, and the gate must say so by name.

`resolved` in compile_function is a bytearray sized to the row, and the REL32
branch assigns a fixed four-byte displacement into it. A site starting at
`target_size-1..-3` therefore GROWS the body past the row instead of failing:
verify_functions then prints two hex dumps of different lengths with nothing
naming the extent, the offset or the symbol, and the straddling write has also
clobbered the row's own last bytes, so the visible diff is not where the fault
is.

Raising is the point. A straddling call displacement means the ROW'S EXTENT is
wrong -- a function's last instruction cannot end after the function does -- so
clipping the write would make the body compare equal on a boundary the ledger
got wrong, which is the silent pass this gate exists to prevent.
