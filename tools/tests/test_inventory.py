check_csv covers functions.csv and symbols.csv only, so the inventory every
queue tool reads for sizes and anonymity has had no shape check at all. These
assert it directly, and that the call-derived starts landed in it stayed
derivable from the retail image rather than becoming a hand-maintained list.

The game-end closure baseline lives here too: `callers_of.py --closure` walks
that same inventory, and its per-tier figures may only move toward source and
