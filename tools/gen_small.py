"""Generate byte-verifiable C++ for the retail executable's tiny functions.

The 1.03 build carries ~43k ghidra-inventoried functions of 16 bytes or less, and
37,716 of them are a single `jmp rel32`. Those have no recoverable identity, but
their bytes are fully determined by their target, so `void j_<rva>() { b_<tgt>(); }`
reproduces one exactly under MSVC 7.1 /O2 (five bytes, E9 + a REL32 reloc) and the
existing gate proves it against the retail bytes. The gate fills the displacement
from a `?b_<tgt>@@YAXXZ` pin in reverse/symbols.csv, so a wrong target or a wrong
pin fails loudly instead of matching anyway.

Subcommands
  classify    write reverse/ghidra_artifacts_blacklist.txt — the small-function
              RVAs that are ghidra boundary artifacts and must never be claimed.
  gen-thunks  write one Code/gen_small/thunks_<batch>.cpp plus its pending ledger
              rows and symbols.csv pins (build/gen_small/thunks_<batch>.json).
  gen-gap-thunks
              the same emission for the `jmp rel32` thunks that live in the
              .text the ghidra inventory never covered: one
              Code/gen_small/gthunks_<batch>.cpp per batch.
  gen-imports write one Code/gen_small/imports_<batch>.cpp for the six-byte
              `FF 25` import thunks; no pins, the gate copies DIR32 sites.
  gen-ehstubs bind the ten-byte `__ehhandler$` stubs in those same gaps to the
              single Code/gen_small/eh_anchor.cpp obj, one chunk of rows per
              run; refuses to emit unless the compiled anchor masked-matches
              three image exemplars first.
  gen-tgrid   write Code/gen_small/tgrid_<batch>.cpp: STLport templates
              instantiated over a synthetic payload grid, claiming the retail
              container bodies those instantiations reproduce byte for byte.
  gen-tinst   the same instantiation, driven the other way round: the element
              type is read OUT of the body's own STLport-decorated name in
              reverse/reloc_names.csv, so the retail body is identified by name
              rather than placed by shape. Writes Code/gen_small/tinst_<batch>.cpp.
  gen-dtors   write one Code/gen_small/dtors_<batch>.cpp (scalar `??_G`) or
              dtorsv_<batch>.cpp (vector `??_E`) batch of synthetic classes whose
              compiler-generated deleting destructors are the retail bodies.
  probe       compile one instance of every anonymous-body skeleton and record
              which ones reproduce the retail bytes exactly (skeleton library).
  gen-shims   write one Code/gen_small/fun_<batch>.cpp of `gen-shim` struct
              methods for the probed skeletons' instances.
  gen-getters write one numbered Code/gen_small/getters_<batch>.cpp containing
              the exact `B8 imm32 C3` bodies held by live gen-dump scaffolds.
  shim-report account for every anonymous FUN_* body: landed, skipped skeleton,
              or out of scope.
  gen-named   write one Code/gen_small/named_<batch>.cpp of the small functions
              ghidra named, under the decorated names a family rule derives and
              this command byte-verifies before emitting.
  sweep-funclets
              match the SEH funclets in already-matched sources' objects against
              the unclaimed retail `Unwind@*`/`Catch@*` inventory by bytes, and
              write the rows that match exactly one of them each way.
  land        append that batch's rows and pins under the ledger lock and prove
              them with ONE ./build.sh; any failure reverts everything.
  land-funclets
              the same transaction for one funclet batch — rows only, since
              those point at parent sources git already tracks.

Every subcommand is idempotent: rerunning one whose output has already landed
reports `0 new` and writes nothing.

Hex convention: C++ identifiers carry the lowercase 8-digit RVA (ghidra spells its
own names that way, FUN_004874e0); ledger and symbols.csv address columns are
0x%08X, per docs/matching.md.

# deleting destructors
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A class with a virtual destructor gets a compiler-generated deleting
# destructor: `??_G` calls the class destructor and then `operator delete`,
# `??_E` does the same over an array through `__ehvec_dtor`. Not one line of the
# game's source is in either, so a synthetic class with a virtual destructor
# reproduces one exactly, and the only bytes that differ between two classes'
# copies are the four-byte relocation slots.
#
# That is what makes the family claimable in bulk and what makes it dangerous:
# every deleting destructor of a shape masked-matches every other one, which is
# how 205 class names once came to be claimed on a single body
# (tools/audit_dtor_aliases.py). So these identities are deliberately anonymous
# -- Gen_dtor_<rva> names an address, never a class -- and every operand is read
# out of the retail bytes rather than assumed: the class destructor each body
# calls becomes that member's own pin, and a body whose operator-delete slot
# reaches anything but the CRT's is refused, because a class that overrides
# operator delete is not the class this recipe writes.

# asserted against the compiled probe's relocations, and a member whose slot
# reaches an address that is not listed is refused by name instead of claimed.
# `??3` is one address on purpose -- a scalar `delete this` that lands anywhere
# else belongs to a class with its own operator delete, which this recipe would
# silently misdescribe.
# `??_V` is one address for the same reason: MSVC 7.1 routes `delete[]` to plain
# `operator delete` in a TU that never declares `operator delete[]`, so the
# retail image holds both spellings of the array slot. The emitted TU declares
# it, which fixes the call at `??_V`, and a body that took the other route is

# UNDECORATED and carry no class and no signature, so they are not by themselves
# a COFF symbol: `expandBy` could be any of a dozen classes' members. A family
# rule here therefore does not translate a ghidra name — it recognises a specific
# function by name AND by the exact retail byte template it must have, and states
# the decorated name outright. One rule per family, no pattern-guessing: if the
# bytes are not the shape the rule assumes, the function is reported underivable
# rather than claimed on the strength of a name collision.
#
# Every operand the rule needs (a call target, a data slot) is read from the
# retail bytes, so the emitted C++ is determined, not inferred. DIR32 sites are
# copied from retail by the gate, which is why an absolute data address may be
# named by a placeholder extern; a REL32 callee is real and gets a pin.

#
# A function compiled with exception handling gets a second COMDAT, `.text$x`,
# holding its unwind funclets and its EH handler stub. Those are ordinary
# defined COFF symbols — the funclets under the compiler's own `$L<n>` labels,
# the stub under `__ehhandler$<parent>` — so a ledger row with an
# `object-symbol=` note byte-verifies one against the retail image with no
# build.py change. Ghidra inventories the retail side as `Unwind@<va>`.
#
# (MSVC 7.1 does NOT emit the `__unwindfunclet$<parent>$<n>` symbols later
# toolchains do: 0 of the 233 cached objects contain one. The parent's identity
# comes from the `__ehhandler$` stub sharing the section, and the row name has
# to be synthesised, because a `$L<n>` label is unique only within its object.)
#
# A funclet body is one or two instructions of destructor call, so the same
# bytes recur across hundreds of parents and cannot attribute anything: picking
# one parent because its bytes fit would be an unfalsifiable row — it
# byte-verifies forever while naming the wrong parent. The retail image states
# ownership outright instead (`funcinfo_ownership`), so the parent comes from
# the FuncInfo tables and the bytes only have to PROVE the pairing the image
# already asserts.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# STL template grid
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The game links STLport 4.5.3, so a container member the retail image holds is
# not lost source: it IS vendor/stlport, instantiated over a payload type. The
# payload's name never reaches the bytes -- only its size, its alignment and
# whether its lifecycle is trivial do -- so instantiating the same template over
# a synthetic payload of the same shape reproduces the retail COMDAT exactly.
#
# Two things decide how a pattern may be claimed:
#
#   (a) A body with no call into the payload's own members is the same code in
#       every instantiation of that shape, so ONE instantiation stands in for
#       every retail site. The rows are `tg_<rva>` with an `object-symbol=` note
#       -- the mangled instantiation name cannot be the row name, because one
#       name may claim only one address.
#   (b) A body that calls the payload's constructor or destructor encodes THAT
#       class's address in a rel32 slot, so each retail site gets its own
#       payload type `Gen_t_<rva>_<shape>` and its own pins. The row name is
#       then the per-site instantiation symbol, unique by construction.
#
# Every callee address is read out of the retail bytes and cross-checked: slots
# naming one symbol inside a body must agree, and a symbol shared across sites
# (operator delete, _M_increment, memmove) is narrowed to the ONE address the
# sites agree on. A site that reaches anything else is refused by name rather
# than resolved through a pin that also answers for something else.

# gen-tinst: container instantiations over the REAL element types
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# gen-tgrid claims what a SHAPE proves: a synthetic payload of some size and
# lifecycle, whose name never reaches the bytes. That is the right instrument
# for an anonymous body, and the wrong one here. ~35 KB of retail container
# members are already NAMED -- reverse/reloc_names.csv and reverse/symbols.csv
# carry their STLport-decorated names, element type and all -- and those names
# are evidence a shape comparison cannot produce. Every four-byte trivially
# assignable element type compiles `_M_fill_insert` to the same 282 bytes, so a
# masked scan over that family names nothing (see the resize family at
# 0x001DC360); the decorated name names it exactly.
#
# So gen-tinst runs the identification backwards from gen-tgrid: it reads the
# element type OUT of the name, instantiates the vendored STLport 4.5.3 template
# over that type, and checks each emitted body against the retail address its own
# name names. Nothing is placed by search, so there is no ambiguity to resolve.

# A cracked family is a recipe: the C++ whose compiled body IS that shape, the
# flags it needs, and the payload types its per-site instantiations are written
# over. The recipes below are the durable output of `family-spike` -- each one
# was proven by compiling it and comparing it against a live unclaimed exemplar
# on every byte outside its relocation slots -- and `family-emit` lands every
# member of every recipe here.
#
# The recipe is a TgSpec because a family and a grid cell are the same object:
# an instantiation, its flags, and its synthetic payloads. `dim` is the census
# family id the spike proved it against, which is what a row's notes cite.
