"""Terminator-preserving ledger rewrite. The ONLY safe way to drop/edit rows.

reverse/functions.csv is not uniformly CRLF: at fa05aaa4b it holds 93,713 rows
ending \r\r\n, 11,140 ending \r\n and 309 ending with a bare \n. Every rewrite
that has split on "\r\n" or used str.splitlines() has silently dropped or
duplicated rows (twice this session):

    text.split("\r\n")   -> 104,854 pieces  (loses 306 rows)
    text.splitlines()    -> 198,875 pieces  (invents 93,713 rows)
    csv.reader(StringIO) -> 105,162 records (correct)

So: parse records with csv.reader for *identity*, but rewrite by operating on
the raw bytes record-by-record, keeping each record's own terminator.
