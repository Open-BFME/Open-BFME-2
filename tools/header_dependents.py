"""Which ledger-backed sources can a header change reach?

Both hooks ran the 40-60 minute full gate for ANY header or shim change, even a
header nothing includes, which made the shared-header work that a linked build
needs (one real header per class instead of private copies) the most expensive
edit in the repository. This bounds the change instead: it walks the #include
graph upward from each changed header and prints the sources that can reach it,
so the hook byte-verifies those and nothing else.

The graph is read from the snapshot being verified -- the index for --staged,
the NEW commit for --range -- never from the working tree, so an unstaged or
uncommitted edit cannot change what is selected.

Under-counting would let a broken TU through, so every doubt widens the set:
  - includes match on file NAME (case-insensitive), never on resolved path, so
    same-named variants in other folders all count;
  - any file a scanned file #includes by name is scanned too, whatever its
    suffix (a .def or .tbl that includes a header carries that edge);
  - a file with a macro include (`#include MACRO`) is treated as including
    every file, changed non-headers included; a `// cl: /FI<name>` forced
    include counts as an include;
  - a directive the line scan cannot read with certainty (a line splice, a
    comment around it, a trigraph, a BOM, a binary-looking file) is re-read
    whole with splices joined and comments blanked; one that still cannot be
    parsed (a malformed operand, UTF-16 text, #pragma include_alias) exits 2;
  - the graph is read from #include text, so a deleted or renamed header's
    includers are still found;
  - a changed .cpp, .c or table that a scanned file #includes by name compiles
    inside that file, so it reaches its includers like a header does;
  - toolchain, vendored-library and STLport changes, or a set larger than
    --limit sources, exit 2: the caller runs the full gate.

  python3 tools/header_dependents.py --staged           # pre-commit
  python3 tools/header_dependents.py --range OLD NEW    # pre-push
exit 0 = the sources to verify, one per line (possibly none); exit 2 = run the
full gate (reason on stderr).
