"""Report how much of the retail .text we hold as source, and what else we claim.

The headline is RECOVERED AS SOURCE: bytes we could rebuild from text a human
can read and edit, which is authored C++ plus the vendored library sources we
compile. Everything else the ledger claims is reported beside it and never
folded into it -- byte-true dumps of retail, prebuilt .lib files we attach, and
machine-written C++. Total exact stays in the report as the target-definition
number: it says which bytes have a fixed boundary, not which bytes we recovered.

Every retail byte is counted once. Clean C++ ownership wins when it overlaps an
assembly-backed row (including ICF aliases), leaving "ASM-only" as actionable
porting debt. This reads the ledger but compiles nothing; build.sh is proof.

      vendored   upstream library source we compile (zlib, JPEG, Lua, STLport,

                 small thunks, template grids.
      library    a prebuilt .lib we attach (d3dx9, CRT). It links, so it is a

    `generated` is the one arguable lane and it is deliberately NOT recovered.
    Those bodies compile from real constructs -- a tail call is a tail call,
    and the funclets fall out of MSVC's codegen rather than out of a hex dump
    -- so they are not scaffolding either, which is why they get a line of
    their own instead of being buried. They are excluded because a script
    writes them: 85,000 of the ledger's rows came from running tools/gen_uw.py
    once, and a headline a script can move is the exact failure this metric
    exists to prevent. The rule is the authorship of the source, not the
    provenance of the bytes: a human wrote it, or a program did. Flipping this
    means putting the generators under human review first, and `code: C++`

    """Bytes we can produce without consulting retail.

    The project is graded on one question: how much of game.dat can we
    rebuild from what we hold? A byte qualifies when its source of truth lives
    in this repo -- C++ someone wrote, upstream library source we compile, a
    deterministic generator we own, or a prebuilt .lib we attach. Who first
    authored it does not enter into it; nobody at EA hand-wrote the unwind
    funclets either, and a 1:1 build does not require us to hand-write d3dx9.

    A byte-true dump is the one lane that fails the test: the source file
    contains retail's own bytes, so deleting game.dat would delete the
    thing we claim to hold. Dumps fix a boundary and say nothing else.
