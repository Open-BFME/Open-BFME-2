"""Needle-place release-library function bodies into retail's library territory.

The linker copied whole COMDATs out of the static libraries this project ships
as build inputs, so 800 KB of retail `.text` is Microsoft's compiled code. The
attached rows prove that per body: `./build.sh` unpacks the archive member a
row's `member=` note names and byte-compares it against retail with every
relocation site masked. This sweep finds the bodies that have not been attached
yet, and it decides where each one went under one explicit standard.

THE COUNT-AGREEMENT STANDARD
----------------------------
A masked body is not a unique fingerprint. A 40-byte prologue-heavy span can
sit at several addresses, and picking one because "it matched" is how a wave
lands 17 wrong addresses. So a placement is only claimed when all three hold:

  in-window        the address lies in the sub-range of [0x9F6C00, 0xB00000)
                   that this library already owns in the ledger. The four
                   libraries occupy four contiguous, non-overlapping runs (see
                   WINDOWS below); a d3dx9 body found inside dxerr9's run is a
                   coincidence, not a placement.
  count-agreement  retail holds no MORE copies of a body than the archive
                   supplies. A class with 3 archive instances and 4 in-window
                   hits is over-subscribed: at least one hit is a collision, we
                   cannot tell which, and the whole class is refused.
  archive-order    with the counts agreeing, the i-th placement by ascending
                   RVA is the i-th instance in archive order. The linker emits
                   COMDATs in the order it pulls members in, so this is the
                   assignment, not a guess among equals.

This is deliberately WEAKER than global uniqueness, which is why the standard
is written down here and in vendor/d3dx9/PROVENANCE.txt rather than left
implicit in a matcher. Its corroborations and its limits are recorded there.

Four tests keep the ordering premise honest, because ordering is the part of the
standard that can be wrong while every byte still matches:

  ledger anchors   a class containing a body the ledger ALREADY attaches is a
                   class whose ordering has a known answer. If ascending-RVA
                   order disagrees with that answer, the premise failed here
                   and the WHOLE class is refused — not just the bad pair.
  callee targets   two masked-identical bodies differ exactly at their
                   relocation slots, and retail has those slots resolved. Every
                   REL32 in a claimed body is decoded and the archive's own
                   copy of the named callee must be at the far end. This is
                   what separates `??_GCSprite` from `??_GCCodec`: 28 identical
                   bytes, but one calls ??1CCodec and the linker wrote that
                   address down. 53 placements ascending order got wrong were
                   caught this way; they are refused, not repaired, because
                   repairing them means choosing among members that define the
                   same COMDAT and that is a second standard, not this one.
  DIR32 bases      the same idea one step out: a DIR32 slot says where a named
                   global went, and a symbol has one address. A placement that
                   puts an anchored symbol somewhere an already-attached row
                   does not is refused, and so is a pair of this wave's own rows
                   that resolve one symbol two ways. build.py runs the same
                   arithmetic over the whole ledger, but only in the FULL gate —
                   a ledger-only commit gets a SCOPED build from both hooks, and
                   the scoped path skips it. Applying it here is what stops a
                   wave landing rows that check will blame after the push.
  twin naming      the tests above refute; this one measures what is left. For
                   each address, every instance of the class that survives all
                   of them is a candidate. When more than one SYMBOL survives,
                   ascending order was a coin flip, and the row is named
                   `?<lib>_twin_<rva>@@YAXXZ` with `object-symbol=` carrying the
                   COMDAT. The bytes are still proved; only the name stops
                   claiming what the image does not witness.

LEGALITY
--------
Placement says where the bytes are. Legality says whether the ledger will take
the row today:

  pure-unclaimed   overlaps no matched row                    -> plain append
  dump-exact       is exactly one gen-dump row's (rva, size)  -> supersede
  dump-padded      a gen-dump row starts here and is longer than the stripped
                   body but still inside the member's raw span, and the raw
                   span masked-verifies over the row's full extent -> supersede
                   at the DUMP row's size (validate_rows only supersedes an
                   exact range, and the trailing bytes are the member's own
                   0xCC padding, which retail kept)
  dump-mismatch    overlaps gen-dump rows on some other extent -> boundary
                   surgery, not this wave's business
  held-overlap     overlaps a real row                        -> refused
