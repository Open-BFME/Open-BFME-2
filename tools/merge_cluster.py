"""Collapse a `readable body of` sibling cluster into one translation unit.

A cluster is the set of files carrying `// readable body of <symbol>: <DEST>` --
bodies that belong in DEST but currently sit one to a file. 1,227 such markers
name 280 destinations across 1,017 files and the largest cluster runs to 62
files, so draining one is many commits, not one. That is why `--only` is
required on `--apply`: a whole-cluster merge is unreviewable, unrebaseable
against a repo taking continuous pushes, and would repoint rows for bodies the
merged TU does not contain.

The marker is the SOLE source of truth for membership. Ledgered siblings without
one are out of scope and `--plan` lists them under "un-clustered siblings" so
they are visible rather than silently omitted.

This tool does the mechanical halves and neither judgement call:

  --list          destinations with two or more files, largest cluster first.
  --plan DEST     the cluster's files, the declarations every sibling shares
                  (free to hoist), the ones that differ (a human reconciles
                  them), and the member declarations that outright contradict.
  --apply DEST --into PATH --only FILE...
                  repoint the rows those donors own at PATH, delete the donors
                  with nothing left, and `git add` the result.

`--apply` does NOT synthesise the merged body. A guessed union of shims
byte-matches while being wrong, which is the one failure ./build.sh cannot see;
writing the merged TU is the step between `--plan` and `--apply`.

24 files carry bodies for more than one destination (`ini_parsers.cpp` for ten),
so a cluster is not a set of files a merge may consume whole. Selection is by
ROW, never by file: a marker names a symbol, so the rows that move are the ones
this donor owns whose symbol one of its markers for THIS destination names.
Everything else stays, and a donor that still owns a row keeps its file -- whether
what holds it back is a marker for another destination or a row no marker claims
at all. Deleting such a donor would leave its remaining rows naming a path that no
longer exists, which is the single way this tool could lose code. `--plan` prints
the marked share against the rows owned so a partial donor is visible first.

Usage:
  python3 tools/merge_cluster.py --list [--root DIR]
  python3 tools/merge_cluster.py --plan DEST [--only FILE...] [--root DIR]
  python3 tools/merge_cluster.py --apply DEST --into PATH --only FILE... [--root DIR]
