"""Run the whole byte gate and report every matched row that no longer verifies.

The commit hooks byte-verify only the sources a commit touches, so a row can rot
-- a shared header edit, a toolchain bump, a neighbouring body moving a label --
while progress.py keeps counting it as matched. Nothing else in this repo runs
the full gate on purpose, which is why every red row found so far was found by
accident.

  python3 tools/red_rows.py

Prints the failing rows and one total line; the gate's byte dumps stay in the
gate. Exit 0 means the gate ran to completion with every row green. A gate that
dies before it reaches byte comparison -- a TU that will not compile exits 2 --
gets its own verdict and never reads as zero red rows: that wall once hid twelve
hours of commits (docs/lessons.md).
