"""Add function starts that only the call graph knows about to the inventory.

Every byte-verified body is retail code, so a `call` inside one points at a real
function whether or not Ghidra found it. Collecting those targets turns up
addresses the inventory has no row for at all -- some genuinely missed, and some
that are mid-function jump targets or the debris of a bad linear decode.

The discriminator is the byte in front of the target: real code between
functions is int3 padding, and a body that ends properly ends in `ret` or a nop
slide. A target that begins immediately after ordinary code is not a boundary,
so it is dropped rather than guessed at. Nothing here reads a proposal file --
the retail image and the two committed inventories are the only inputs.
