"""Match unclaimed retail bodies against an already-compiled source, STRUCTURALLY.

Why the obvious approach fails. When a class is relaid out, the natural sweep is
"find a compiled COMDAT of the same length as the retail row, then diff". That is
structurally blind here: BFME's offsets cross the disp8/disp32 boundary, so a
3-byte `mov ecx,[ecx+0x0C]` becomes a 6-byte `mov ecx,[ecx+0x188]`. THE RELAYOUT
CHANGES INSTRUCTION LENGTHS, NOT JUST CONSTANTS. Measured on Object.cpp: of 135
unclaimed rows in its range, only 13 have an equal-length candidate at all, and
121 have none.

So compare SHAPE, not bytes or length. Each instruction is normalised to its
mnemonic plus its operand form with every displacement and immediate erased:

    mov ecx,[ecx+0x0C]    ->   mov r,[r+K]
    mov ecx,[ecx+0x188]   ->   mov r,[r+K]        <- same shape, different length

By default two bodies match when their whole normalised sequences are EQUAL.
That finds the already-written body whose only defect is the layout constants,
which is the situation in a file like Object.cpp where the source is present and
correct apart from the offsets.

But exact equality is all-or-nothing, and that is its main limitation. In
practice a BFME body often differs from its ZH counterpart by ONE added guard,
ONE extra call, or ONE inlined callee -- and exact mode misses every one of
those. A lane landing six rows found that five of them were invisible to it and
had to be located by hand. `--near 0.85` relaxes equality to a similarity ratio
over the same shapes and recovers them: on that range it offered 21 distinct
rows as candidates where exact mode offered 1.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. A shape match is a CANDIDATE, never a claim: erasing the
constants erases real distinctions, so two genuinely different methods over the
same layout can share a shape -- and --near widens that gap deliberately. The
byte gate still decides. Expect ICF twins in the output (they are labelled), and
expect the trap that a perfect shape match can still be the WRONG FUNCTION: on
this range one such match was a module finder keyed on a different NAMEKEY
literal, which is the "green is not a data model" case in miniature.
