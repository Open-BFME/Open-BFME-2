"""Refuse changes that run the conversion direction backward: asm -> C++ only.

Usage:  conversion_gate.py OLD NEW
        OLD/NEW are git revisions; NEW may be ":" for the staged index.

Rule A: added lines under Code/ (outside Code/gen_small/) may not contain
        __declspec(naked) or _emit/__emit. Machine byte-dumps belong to
        tools/gen_dump.py in Code/gen_small/; a proven codegen blocker
        (x87, SEH) belongs in Code/masm_dumps/*.asm. Eighteen fleet commits
        titled "convert ... to exact C++" deleted real C++ bodies and added
        __emit thunks — byte-verification passes on those, so this is the
        only gate that can see them.

Rule B: a matched RVA that had at least one clean-C++ source in OLD must
        still have one in NEW. Retracting a wrong claim (row deleted or
        status changed) is legal and must be its own commit; repointing a
        live clean claim at a dump is never legal.

Rule C: Code/gen_asm/ is machine output and stays that way. C1 every added
        line there must match the generator's grammar, so a lift of a NAMED
        function cannot be expressed in the directory at all; C2 every added
        ledger row pointing there is anonymous (?d_<rva>@@YAXXZ, notes
        gen-dump), so a dump can never squat an identity byte-verification
        cannot falsify; C3 a wave commit may not touch any other file under
        Code/, so a deleted C++ body cannot ride inside a diff of 33,000
        unreadable `db` lines. Rule A needs no exemption here and gets none:
        a `db` dump matches neither NAKED_RE nor LIFT_RE, and source_kind
        scores a .asm file as assembly unconditionally, so the offence Rule A
        polices -- inflating the C++ lane with re-encoded binary -- is not
        expressible in this directory.
