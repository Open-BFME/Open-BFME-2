"""BFME struct member names at binary-proven offsets, joined on the INI key.

Both games parse their INI files through the same table shape --
`{const char* token; INIFieldParseProc parse; const void* userData; Int offset;}`
-- so the retail exe carries, in plain .rdata, the offset of every field an INI
file can set, and upstream carries the C++ member name each key writes. Joining
them on the key recovers names for offsets that are already proven, which is
what `docs/ini_schema.md` used to carry before its generator was deleted in
a4b1dde and left that file unregenerable.

**The offset always comes from the binary and only the name from upstream.**
BFME moved fields (`ScatterRadiusVsInfantry` is +0x514 here, +0x60 upstream), so
an upstream offset would silently corrupt a layout -- and these are shim
declarations, which the byte gate cannot see. The upstream index therefore
stores no offsets at all: there is nothing here to fall back to. An entry whose
offset dword decodes as neither a struct offset nor a pointer aborts its whole
table by name.

What counts as a table: a maximal run of well-formed entries in a
non-executable section, closed by a NULL-token entry. Two independent misreads
are excluded structurally rather than by taste --

  * an entry whose offset dword is a mapped pointer is a 16-byte window over an
    array of 8-byte `{name, proc}` pairs (lua's `getlocal`/`setlocal` table),
    not a field entry, and it ends the run;
  * a lone record closed by a terminator is the shape of every other 16-byte
    `{name, proc, 0, 0}` array in .data -- the INI block keywords, the menu
    callbacks -- so a one-entry run counts only if something in the image points
    at its address. Two or more records sharing a terminator is not a shape
    anything else here has, and stands on its own: ThingTemplate's
    `Draw`/`Geometry` table is reached by arithmetic and no dword in the image
    holds its address.

A key that names one upstream member is that member. A key several upstream
classes define is resolved only when the table's own class vote decides it --
every other key in that table voting `WeaponTemplate` is what makes
`AttackRange` its `m_attackRange` and not `SlavedUpdateModuleData`'s. A tie
decides nothing (margin 0), and a key left unresolved is written with no name
and its candidates in `notes`. It is never guessed.
