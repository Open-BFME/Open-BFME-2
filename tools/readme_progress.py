"""Render the README card and the daily Discord post: four measures, four bars.

Each measure has its own stated denominator:

  REBUILT FROM SOURCE  everything that rebuilds to the original's exact bytes
                       (our C++, library source, generated C++, attached
                       prebuilt libraries: progress.py's REBUILDS, counted
                       without 0xCC), over all code.
  GAME CODE IN C++     our own C++ (progress.py's authored lane), over the
                       game's own code: all code minus vendored library source
                       and prebuilt libraries.
  LINKING              the part of that C++ in files that link cleanly, over
                       the game's own code on the census tree. The link census
                       (tools/link_census.py) stores both (linked_authored,
                       game_code); they are never recomputed here, so Linking
                       is one snapshot and holds still between censuses.

The card and the post draw the same numbers. The change shown beside a number
is the change in that bar's percentage since the last post, measured from the
figures the post saved (docs/discord-progress.json), so output depends
only on the repository: no clock enters the card. progress.py prints the full
breakdown.

When the census measuring Linking changed its rules since the last post (the
history row's `rules`), the two percentages measure different things: the
Linking bar then shows "rules changed" and the previous figure with its rules,
never an arrow.

Under the bars, a line gives the strict link check from the committed
link_cycle receipt (reverse/link_cycle/receipt.json, stored by
tools/progress_v2.py --store-receipt): the tree linked at the original's
addresses with every reference checked. Self-strict counts placed code whose
own references land where retail's do; fully linked (closed-strict) also needs
everything it reaches to be right. Both are shares of retail .text, as the
receipt counts them, with the receipt's date and commit. It sits beside the
census's Linking bar, never in place of it: the census asks whether each file
links on its own, the receipt whether the program links at retail addresses.
