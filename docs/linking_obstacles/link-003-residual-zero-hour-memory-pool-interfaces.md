### LINK-003: residual Zero Hour memory-pool interfaces

**Status: Open. Updated: 2026-10-25.**

- **Evidence / scope:** historical blockers include `MemoryPool::freeBlock`
  in 21 units and `allocateBlockImplementation` in 15; these sets overlap and
  predate later repairs. The inspected provider index has neither operation.
- **Completed:** `d7d2a0c653` changed the sweep `GameMemory.h` to BFME 2's native
  virtual destruction / global delete and global allocation contract. BFME 1
  and ZH interfaces remain reference leads, not proof of BFME 2 behavior.
- **Remaining / next check:** find residual imported declarations and callers,
  prove their native BFME 2 contracts, and repair the class/header family.
  [Scripts.cpp's handoff](../../reverse/attempt_support/network-byte-setter-astra-s2-20261023/readme.md)
  records pool calls alongside ScriptGroup/OrCondition, signed-byte and parser
  ABI blockers. Removing a pool call does not clear those other dependencies.
  Verify the affected consumers together; clearance and census confirmation
  remain pending.
