# Linking obstacle register

Required reading before selecting linking work; required updates with repairs
and attempt handoffs, and before ending a linking pass. Workflow:
[linking.md](linking.md#shared-obstacle-register). This is a shared handoff,
not an authoritative progress counter. Claim work through the normal claim tool.

Read the [linking target checklist](linking_targets.md) alongside this register
when selecting work. Update affected target rows with results, evidence and
remaining dependencies in the repair or handoff commit.

## Maintaining this register

- Update only the entries your evidence affects. Record the date, source revision,
  affected symbols/units, work completed, verification result, remaining blockers
  and next useful check. Link a repair commit or tracked attempt evidence. For
  previews, identify the index revision, current-input checks and measured scope;
  put detailed receipts in the repair's normal evidence location.
- Reuse an existing ID for the same cause; give a new cause the next unused
  `LINK-NNN` ID. If a broad entry is only partly repaired, keep it open and list
  the repaired subset or split off a narrower entry. Do not mark a whole family
  cleared because one consumer links.
- Use **Open** for an unresolved lead, **Blocked** with a named prerequisite,
  **Repair landed / awaiting verification** for an unconfirmed repair, and
  **Cleared** only with verification of the stated scope against current inputs.
  State separately whether a later census confirms it. A preview clearance does
  not change the headline; a source edit or provider's existence alone is not
  proof that its consumers now link.
- Keep cleared entries and their evidence. Reopen an entry with the new failing
  revision and evidence if it regresses. Preserve other agents' updates when
  rebasing. Do not repeat an unchanged failed trial without new evidence or a
  resolved prerequisite.

For a new entry, use this shape:

```text
### LINK-NNN: concrete cause and affected scope
Status: Open. Updated: YYYY-MM-DD; inspected revision: <SHA>.
Evidence / affected units: <symbols, files, tracked evidence, index revision>.
Completed: <repair or attempt, commit and measured result, or none yet>.
Remaining / next check: <specific dependency and how to verify it>.
Clearance: <scope, current-input verification and evidence, or pending>.
Census confirmation: <published measurement revision, or awaiting / not claimed>.
```

## Baseline for the initial entries

Seeded on **2026-10-25** from the investigation at `76efac458e`.
The historical census measured `d2636bb381` at **2026-10-25 09:42 UTC**;
its status was published by `b78c9ed16e`. It records **7,343,016 / 7,512,658
executable-game bytes (97.7419%)**, leaving 169,642 bytes and 385 blocked units.
Use the published status: the status file inside the measured commit itself
describes the preceding census.

The official provider index inspected had provider facts updated to `51fde01dff`
at **2026-10-25 13:53 UTC**, but retained the 09:42 census's blocker lists.
Index SHA-256:
`7225d4beb4d607e264bb010fef0dc8fdcb36d15b684d16fc7e654ee776a037ed`.
Thus the counts below are historical leads, not freshly measured failures on
master. Recheck current inputs before choosing work. The register's initial
entries claim no new census or current-master compile result.

Start by verifying landed repairs, then reconcile container identities and
shared headers/providers in coherent batches. Do not total overlapping units,
authored-byte previews or commit-title gains into a projected headline.

## Obstacles and handoffs

### LINK-001: landed repairs still appear in the historical census

**Status: Repair landed / awaiting verification. Updated: 2026-10-25.**

- **Evidence / scope:** the deleting destructor
  `??_EWeightInfoStruct@NamedPivotMapClass@@QAEPAXI@Z` blocked 34 graphics units;
  it was the sole blocker in 30, holding 45,189 authored nonpadding bytes
  (about 45 KB). The inspected provider index now has 33 retail-correct copies
  with identical digests. Provider evidence alone does not remeasure consumers.
- **Verified graphics subset (2026-10-25, `91fe970939`):**
  [the bounded verification](../reverse/attempt_support/weightinfo-verification-20261025/readme.md)
  passes 404/404 matched rows across all 34 units. Current-object inspection
  confirms 33 retail-correct copies and a correct selected body; W3DScene
  intentionally stopped emitting the incorrect copy. No destructor blocker
  remains in these 34 objects. The ordinary preview links all 30 historical
  sole-blocker units, covering **45,204 authored nonpadding bytes**. The other
  four retain unrelated dependencies, listed in that evidence. This graphics
  subset is **cleared in the bounded ordinary-preview scope**; census and
  closed-strict confirmation remain unclaimed. Strict receipt prerequisites
  found during verification are tracked separately as LINK-008.
- **Completed:** `51fde01dff` removed W3DScene's nonretail emission; its source
  was unchanged at investigation time. The earlier graphics gains overlap.
  Other landed repairs also have scoped evidence:
  [PlayerTemplate bucket copy](../reverse/attempt_support/object476-copy-link-20261025/readme.md),
  [record helpers](../reverse/attempt_support/asciistring-record-link-20261025/readme.md)
  and [narrow strings](../reverse/attempt_support/narrow-string-selective-link-20261025.md).
  Several historical `_Destroy` names already resolve to defined providers.
- **Remaining / next check:** check the next normal maintainer census for the
  verified graphics subset. Verify the other landed repair families' current
  consumers and providers before attempting another repair.
  Do not reopen a repaired name solely because `link_rank.py` still lists it.
- **Range-worker current-input check (2026-10-25, after `e302344089`):**
  [the paired range-worker proof](../reverse/attempt_support/range-destroy-link-20261025/readme.md)
  verifies 71/71 rows, 7 EXACT exception graphs and three strict receipts.
  The provider and both deferred-vector consumer files already preview cleanly
  with current alias handling, despite the historical unresolved names. One
  real whole-body C++ instantiation replaces its old alias and retires one
  hatch key; the paired before/after preview preserves all 2,978 authored
  bytes and claims no new linking gain. The other alias remains debt.
- **Placement-copy register cleanup (2026-10-26, `1cd28a3a88`):**
  [the current-object retirement](../reverse/attempt_support/vector-copy-identity-retirement-20261026.md)
  verifies all three rows (428 bytes) in stlport_vector_rva00287f76_overflow.cpp
  and stlport_vector_rva00336aec_overflow.cpp. Their existing native-owner
  forwarding passes `repair_queue.py retire identity`, which removes both stale
  wrong-copy keys. The current census already records both units as linking;
  no new byte or census gain is claimed.
- **Clearance / census confirmation:** graphics ordinary-preview scope cleared
  at the revision above; other families and census confirmation remain pending.
  Keep individual repair previews separate from later census confirmation.

### LINK-002: distinct container element identities and exception contracts

**Status: Open. Updated: 2026-10-25.**

- **Evidence / scope:** equal-sized `BfmePod28` / `BfmePod32` views conflate
  native types with different constructors and copy operations. The
  [element-split handoff](../reverse/attempt_support/pod-element-split-20261023/readme.md)
  names the provider and consumers: the vector at `0x00541434` calls copy helper
  `0x005411C8`, while its current spelling resolves to `0x00215F38`; the vector
  at `0x0052C823` calls `0x0052C27E`, not `0x00421D28`.
- **Completed / failed trials:** the
  [vector exception-contract bank](../reverse/attempt_support/vector-587c40-construct-link-20261025/readme.md)
  shows that a throwing copy declaration preserves the 189-byte parent but emits
  the wrong helper; `throw()` fixes that helper while breaking the parent.
  Suppressing the control overflow definition also broke another matched row.
  These trials were restored; they are not repairs.
- **Remaining / next check:** reconcile element identity, native callees,
  ownership, shared declarations and EH contracts together. Verify every
  affected provider, consumer and emitted copy. Size equality and a renamed
  template do not prove a shared native type. Clearance and census confirmation
  remain pending.
- **AerialPathfinder concrete candidate (2026-10-25, `27b23d675b`):**
  [the native-list bank](../reverse/attempt_support/aerial-native-list-link-20261025/readme.md)
  identifies a conflation between the constructor's `BfmePod8` destructor pin
  at 002FECBC and this family's actual cleanup at 004EC395. Private adoption
  of the canonical subsystem base and the target query's polygon/height entry
  preserves the 75/59/28-byte parent/wrapper bodies and both exact EH graphs.
  No production repair was applied: required helper addresses 0014F3C4 and
  004EC395 were reserved by other workers. Resume through normal folded-body
  admission and current-input provider/consumer gates when claims permit;
  preserve the shared pin and do not equate unrelated equal-sized records.

### LINK-003: residual Zero Hour memory-pool interfaces

**Status: Open. Updated: 2026-10-25.**

- **Evidence / scope:** historical blockers include `MemoryPool::freeBlock`
  in 21 units and `allocateBlockImplementation` in 15; these sets overlap and
  predate later repairs. The inspected provider index has neither operation.
- **Completed:** `d7d2a0c653` changed the sweep `GameMemory.h` to BFME 2's native
  virtual destruction / global delete and global allocation contract. BFME 1
  and ZH interfaces remain reference leads, not proof of BFME 2 behavior.
- **Remaining / next check:** find residual imported declarations and callers,
  prove their native BFME 2 contracts, and repair the class/header family.
  [Scripts.cpp's handoff](../reverse/attempt_support/network-byte-setter-astra-s2-20261023/readme.md)
  records pool calls alongside ScriptGroup/OrCondition, signed-byte and parser
  ABI blockers. Removing a pool call does not clear those other dependencies.
  Verify the affected consumers together; clearance and census confirmation
  remain pending.

### LINK-004: missing or incompatible shared providers and declarations

**Status: Open. Updated: 2026-10-25.**

- **Evidence / scope:** recurring historical names include `AudioEventRTS`
  destruction, assignment and `setObjectID`; `UpdateModule::crc`;
  `DamageInfo` / `DamageInfoInput` / `DamageInfoOutput` transfer methods;
  `INI::scanIndexList`; `ParticleSystemManager::createParticleSystem`;
  `Object::setProducer` / `setStatus`; and `DISABLEDMASK_NONE`.
- **Completed:** the initial `link_rank.py --owner-gaps --top 12 --near 3`
  inspection found 23 unresolved names with matched-address candidates. This
  is an ownership lead, not a repair or identity proof.
- **Verified special-power subset (2026-10-25, inspected `777d0ff0aa`):**
  [current verification](../reverse/attempt_support/specialpower-dtor-verification-20261025/readme.md)
  confirms upstream `bcac7d81eb` removed the protected/public destructor
  mismatch for CashHack and Defector. Normal gates pass 14/14 rows across the
  two callers and two provider units, with 2/2 EH graphs EXACT; all four units
  have strict current receipts. Against index `51fde01dff` (13:53 UTC), with
  all four requested objects current, both callers preview cleanly for their
  already-counted 422 bytes. This binding/ordinary-preview subset is cleared;
  no new headline gain or census confirmation is claimed.
- **Remaining special-power prerequisite:** the actual destructor's unit
  `SpecialPowerModuleDtor_Unresolved.cpp` still conflicts on the two
  BehaviorModule vtables and the SpecialPowerModule vtable (three first-copy
  COMDAT findings). Reconcile those native class/table definitions before
  claiming the family's closed-strict or executable closure; the scoped
  evidence above records the exact names. The broader entry remains open.
- **Native-interface/debt follow-up (2026-10-25, after `17d211067f`):**
  [the bounded zero-slot repair and ABI handoff](../reverse/attempt_support/behavior-zero-slot-hatch-20261025/readme.md)
  replaces one linker alias with a real, whole-body-verified C++ zero-result
  slot and consistent declarations in the constructor/companion units.
  All 9 rows, 3 EH graphs and 3 strict receipts pass; the enforced hatch
  register retires one alias. The 624 already-linked cohort bytes are kept,
  with the same three remaining provider-table conflicts. No new headline
  gain or family clearance is claimed. Native table inspection also shows
  that the indexed ZH-shaped 14/34-slot bases are not the retail contract:
  the primary native base has 12 slots, and the secondary run/signatures
  require reconciliation, including the class-contract queue's final slot.
  Use the handoff's exact table anchors before adopting shared declarations.
- **`AudioEventRTS` destruction/assignment subset (2026-10-25, inspected
  `b620cdb046`):**
  - The shared names are two pins:
    `??1AudioEventRTS@@UAE@XZ` -> `0x004EC395` (the folded STLport
    `_List_base` destructor) and `??4AudioEventRTS@@QAEAAV0@ABV0@@Z` ->
    `0x000366F0` (`StringBase<char>::set`).
  - `tools/name_dependents.py` finds 17 units, compiled against Zero Hour
    headers, whose objects reference them. Trial: drop both pins and build
    all 17. 15 units stay exact; exactly 2 rows fail:
    - `??4DynamicAudioEventRTS@@QAEAAV0@ABV0@@Z` (`0x00200BC0`, 25 B,
      `ThingFactory.cpp`). Retail copies only a `StringBase<char>` at +4 via
      `StringBase::set`, so this body is not an `AudioEventRTS` assignment.
      The masked-search placement is no identity proof.
    - `??1?$pair@VAsciiString@@VAudioEventRTS@@@_STL@@QAE@XZ` (`0x002A12E1`,
      `ThingTemplate.cpp`). Retail destroys `second` at +4 through the folded
      list destructor `0x004EC395`, then `first` through
      `StringBase<char>::~StringBase` (`0x00036410`), so the BFME 2 map value
      is not a 0x88 event.
  - These two pins block naming the canonical 0x88 class
    (`BfmeAudioEventPrefix136`, `Code/GameEngine/Include/Common/BfmeAudioEventPrefix136.h`)
    `AudioEventRTS`. The retail `AudioEventRTS.cpp` `__FILE__` string is
    referenced at `0x002D9ADC`, inside that class's translation unit
    (`0x002D94CE..0x002DAB18`). With the rename, its virtual destructor
    (`0x002D9A43`) would share a mangled name with the pin at `0x004EC395`.
    `pin_consistency` refuses that, and the link would select one body for
    both.
  - **Next check:** re-identify the two rows' real BFME 2 types (a
    {+0, `StringBase<char>` +4} class with assignment; a map value whose
    destructor folds with the list base). Retype them so they call those
    callees by their own names, then drop both pins. Re-run the 17-unit
    trial before the canonical rename.
- **INI bucket initializer repaired (2026-10-25, control `349db6dc10`):**
  [the scoped provider repair](../reverse/attempt_support/ini-bucket-provider-link-20261025/readme.md)
  makes INI emit the retail 59-byte initializer at `0x00148DDF` and applies its
  prime-search configuration before the relevant include. INI's wrong-binding
  count falls from one to zero. All 203 cohort rows and 13 EH graphs pass;
  the bounded ownership diagnostic clears INI's 2,989 authored bytes. Existing
  provider debt is recorded in the handoff. This subset is cleared in the
  scoped diagnostic; global closure and census confirmation remain pending.
- **Remaining / next check:** resolve the real existing owner, parameter types,
  ABI and data ownership from native references; reconcile canonical headers
  with implementations and consumers as a batch. Verify all affected rows and
  selected definitions. Do not add a duplicate identity, stub or escape hatch
  to satisfy an old spelling. Clearance and census confirmation remain pending.

### LINK-005: units blocked by several incompatible dependencies

**Status: Open. Updated: 2026-10-25.**

- **Evidence / scope:** the historical blocker lists contain ConnectionManager
  (51 names), particle-module copy constructors (28), MapUtil (26), `texture.cpp`
  (21) and `ww3d.cpp` (20). These counts overlap the causes above and are not
  counts of independent missing implementations.
- **Completed:** the initial investigation grouped these as coordinated repair
  families; it made no source repairs or current-object measurements.
- **Remaining / next check:** refresh each unit's actual blockers, then reconcile
  shared string/map/vector views, destructors/vtables, signatures and graphics
  interfaces. Track resolved subsets and remaining names here or in a linked
  family handoff. A repaired dependency is partial progress until all blockers
  in the stated unit scope are checked. Clearance and census confirmation
  remain pending.

### LINK-006: compiler emission and the selected copy still disagree with retail

**Status: Open. Updated: 2026-10-25.**

- **Evidence / scope:** string erase/replace helpers and Render2D container
  destruction can resolve a symbol while retaining an incorrect selected body.
  Read the [prior linking handoff](../reverse/attempt_support/link-seat-20261025-final.md)
  and its referenced string/compiler banks before trying another emission shape.
  The vector parent/helper contract in LINK-002 is another concrete example.
- **Completed:** selective emission has repaired some other families, recorded
  under LINK-001; it does not establish a fix for these remaining cases.
- **FX-list constructor subset cleared in ordinary preview (2026-10-25,
  after `feb95824fa`):**
  [the full dependency proof](../reverse/attempt_support/fxlist-constructor-link-20261025/readme.md)
  restores allocator/forwarder visibility and replaces the sibling's wrong
  bucket-count emission with the retail copy. Normal gates prove the complete
  48/59/64-byte helpers, 19/19 cohort rows, four exact EH graphs and four strict
  current receipts. All four current units preview cleanly against index
  `51fde01dff`; the store constructor's 109 authored bytes are now included in
  that bounded clean scope. The paired evidence distinguishes actual source
  repair from alias-driven uncertainty in the old control. The broader
  value-layout and string/container entries remain open; census and executable
  closure are unclaimed.
- **Final FX-list provider scope:** the same proof also removes the constructor
  unit's wrong clear copy in favor of the existing 73-byte owner at 0060CFB6.
  Expanded verification passes 26 rows across five sources, four exact EH
  graphs, five strict receipts and zero new identity findings. FXList.cpp's
  clear operation is verified, while its whole 620-byte unit still has separate
  particle/terrain/drawable bindings, two nugget tables and list-lifetime
  blockers, detailed in the proof. Only the original four-unit ordinary-preview
  scope is cleared; the broader entry remains open.
- **Remaining / next check:** prove the native provider and inspect all emitted
  symbols, relocations, parent extents and EH graphs with current inputs. Merely
  suppressing a helper or changing an exception declaration can break a matched
  parent. Clearance and census confirmation remain pending for this scope.

- **FX-list obsolete-emission subset (2026-10-25, inspected `9edfc2834c`):**
  [the bounded cleanup and identity handoff](../reverse/attempt_support/fxlist-obsolete-emissions-20261025/readme.md)
  removes unused Zero Hour callbacks and retains the bone-position method out
  of line. All seven existing bodies and all their relocations are unchanged;
  normal byte/data gates and a strict current receipt pass. Against the fixed
  `ef9c691284` index, the obsolete drawable call and bone-position table conflict
  disappear. The 620-byte unit still does not link; no census gain is claimed.
  The two remaining list pins target StringBase operations (000365F0 and
  00036E70), and the 0052BD3A copy installs the existing one-string C61A20 table.
  Declaration-only suppression introduces unresolved references, so the next
  step is a coherent ownership/provider/consumer correction, preserving coverage.
  The separate particle table and legacy particle/terrain calls remain open.
  A supported identity-retirement attempt refused missing/stale provider evidence;
  no baseline was changed.

- **Map-metadata selected-copy subset (2026-10-25, inspected `d4cd9b535c`):**
  [the read-only cache-reference repair](../reverse/attempt_support/map-metadata-borrow-link-20261025/readme.md)
  stops SkirmishGameOptionsMenu.cpp from instantiating its shorter Zero Hour
  metadata copy and related tree-copy operations. Native positioning helpers
  independently show that the borrowed metadata and coordinates are read-only.
  Normal gates pass 56 rows across six current sources, 13 exact EH graphs and
  six strict receipts with independently checked object hashes. A fixed-facts
  paired ordinary preview clears four caller units (2,295 authored nonpadding
  bytes). This bounded subset awaits census confirmation; the legacy menu's
  other dependencies and MapMetaDataCopyDeferred's waypoint-tree identity/provider
  conflicts remain open. No whole-family or executable closure is claimed.

### LINK-007: incomplete data ownership beyond clean symbol resolution

**Status: Open; three storage subsets repaired. Updated: 2026-10-25.**

- **Evidence / scope:** the [linking handoff](../reverse/attempt_support/link-seat-20261025-final.md)
  identifies missing shader/filter root objects and the unowned 52-byte
  ScreenBWFilter group at `0x009B5B54`. Complete native objects and vtables are
  prerequisites; a symbol alone does not prove their storage or relocations.
- **Completed:** the [VP6 storage repair](../reverse/attempt_support/vp6-idct-storage-link-20261025/readme.md)
  proves the table's 548-byte allocation and records a fixed-comparison
  **17,413-byte placed closed-strict gain**. Those units already counted as
  linked in the headline. This is scoped closure evidence, not a new headline
  measurement of master; follow that lane's clean-room rules.
- **Filter adjacency repaired (2026-10-25):** the
  [modifier/pointer ownership proof](../reverse/attempt_support/vp6-filter-adjacency-link-20261025/readme.md)
  preserves native `g_bfmeDeringModifiers+0x100 == g_bfmeFilterLimit` in one
  verified 260-byte owner. The six-unit control passes 13/13 bodies (5,862
  bytes); all 13 affected data relocations keep their native targets. The
  authoritative fixed comparison `026edbcbcc` to `a7637e3b22` changes exactly
  four of 23,460 canonical objects and gains **2,369 placed closed-strict
  bytes** in seven rows, with no losses. All seven former unit failures are
  self-strict; six are also closed-strict, together with the FilterBlock2d
  caller. The independent closure report reproduces all 98,202 status rows.
  This is scoped closure evidence, not a new census headline.
- **Scaler coefficients repaired (2026-10-25, inspected `d0c913e6dde`):**
  [the six-scaler ownership repair](../reverse/attempt_support/vp6-scale-tables-link-20261025/readme.md)
  gives the five shared native coefficient addresses one owner each instead of
  22 private copies. Normal controls pass 6/6 bodies (1,739 bytes), all five
  eight-byte data owners and all 64 native DIR32 targets. The authoritative
  fixed comparison `a7637e3b22` to `7124e772c5` gains **1,739 placed
  closed-strict bytes** in the six scalers, with zero losses. All five datum
  nodes pass; exactly five of 23,460 canonical objects change. Independent
  reconstruction reproduces all 98,202 status rows and the 1,700,931-byte
  credit. This scoped
  scaler repair is **cleared in the fixed comparison**; no current census
  headline change is claimed. Native alignment padding remains unowned.
- **Remaining / next check:** shader/filter root-object ownership remains
  open. The [current witnesses](../reverse/attempt_support/vp6-scale-tables-link-20261025/remaining-witnesses.json)
  show InitPostProcessing still closure-blocked through GetProcessorFlags and
  CpuProbe_VendorSse2: the selected `__except_handler3` import twin lacks a
  confirmed map/object definition. UtilMachineSpecificConfig independently
  reaches FilterBlock2dBil's `g_bfmeTableC7E0` forward-map conflict. Prove those
  selected providers and native storage relationships; do not retry the cleared
  coefficient or filter-pointer splits. Verify storage
  extents, initial bytes, relocations and dependent closure through the existing
  gates. Family clearance and later census confirmation remain pending.
  Preserve the no-stubs/no-`/FORCE` runtime exit requirements.

### LINK-008: include inventories prevent strict reusable graphics receipts

**Status: Blocked on complete include inventories. Updated: 2026-10-25.**

- **Evidence / scope:** [graphics verification at `91fe970939`](../reverse/attempt_support/weightinfo-verification-20261025/readme.md)
  ran the normal gates successfully for 34 units, but its initial 17-unit
  `--prepare-current` run refused strict reuse. W3DShadowTextureCtor,
  W3DDebrisDraw, W3DDebrisDrawLegacy and W3DVolumetricShadow reported macro or
  parent-traversing include roots, or headers outside inventoried search roots.
- **Completed:** all 34 ordinary byte/receipt checks pass; 13 objects also have
  strict reusable receipts. The other 17 units were checked through the ordinary
  path; no claim is made that all of them are uncacheable. The refusal is retained
  in the evidence, and no gate was relaxed. LINK-001's destructor preview result
  does not establish strict closure.
- **Remaining / next check:** prove and make the actual include graph
  inventoryable under the existing gates, then repeat bounded strict preparation
  for all affected providers/consumers. A needed verifier repair follows the
  separate false-reject workflow. Do not substitute ordinary receipts for strict
  witnesses. Clearance and closed-strict confirmation remain pending; no census
  change is claimed for this inventory work.

### LINK-009: split-identity destructors; the alias route needs an admission path

**Status: Blocked on an identity merge or a maintainer admission decision.
Updated: 2026-10-25; inspected revision: `4e835ab16a6`.**

- **Evidence / scope:** constructors matched under one class name whose retail
  destructor is matched under a second, address-derived name, so the unit's
  `??1X` stays unresolved. Six units are affected, 661 authored bytes:
  GameSpyInfoCtor.cpp 280 B (`??1GameSpyInfo`), ExperienceTrackerAutoResolve.cpp
  113 B, Rva0022BD9ASubsystem.cpp 67 B, Rva0022C0CDSubsystemCtor.cpp 81 B,
  Rva0022BE0FSubsystemCtor.cpp 65 B and Rva0022BD25SubsystemCtor.cpp 55 B.
  Retail proves each pair: the unit's constructor installs a vtable whose slot 0
  deleting destructor calls the matched body, and two pairs are additionally
  anchored by address adjacency (`0x0041EFFF` + 67 = `0x0041F042`;
  `0x0041F913` + 55 = `0x0041F94A`). Banked detail and the per-class table:
  [split-identity handoff](../reverse/attempt_support/split-identity-dtors-20261024/readme.md).
- **Completed:** a full-form `/alternatename` trial on all six units re-verified
  28/28 rows and linked `LINKED 0 -> 661` bytes at census index 2026-10-24 10:28
  (`2fbdec0868`). It was reverted: the current rules forbid adding
  `/alternatename` by hand, hatch counts may rise only through an admitted tool,
  and the counter's own `--allow`/`--admit` is hand-adding. No admission tool
  covers this hatch, so the evidence is preserved as an attempt, not a repair.
- **Remaining / next check:** choose an admissible route. Preferred is an
  identity merge of the placeholder destructor class into the class the
  constructor/vtable prove, sharing one class view among every unit that emits
  the vtable; that is still blocked on `rename.py` support for a
  placeholder-to-real merge and on the class-view/COMDAT cases recorded in the
  handoff (GameLogic/SubsystemInterface slots, the ExperienceTrackerXfer vtable
  COMDAT, BaseHeightMapRenderObjClass and GlobalWeatherSystem whose rowed names
  are deleting destructors only). Otherwise a maintainer decision is needed for
  a scoped admission path. Do not repeat the unchanged alias trial.
- **Clearance / census confirmation:** pending; no census change is claimed and
  the alias trial was not published.

### LINK-010: folded STL table bases need the actual native predecessor

**Status: Blocked on supported native data-placement / ownership reconciliation.
Updated: 2026-10-25; inspected revision: `4f111811802`.**

- **Evidence / scope:** [the signed-reference handoff](../reverse/attempt_support/stl-tenscale-predecessor-link-20261025/readme.md)
  proves the full 640-byte tenpow and 160-byte twoexp arrays in
  `stlport_stl_atod.cpp`, all six native DIR32 references, and a normal 5/5
  body control. A read-only replay of `a7637e3b22` re-proves inputs and
  reproduces all 98,202 status rows and the fixed-comparison credit.
- **Completed:** the cause is narrowed beyond symbol visibility. Tenpow's
  folded -4/-8 references precede its own COFF contribution and collide with
  Initialize_get_float's digits literal in the measured image. Retail instead
  reaches the end/padding of the canonical `__hex_char_table_hi` at VA BBC910,
  owned by `stlport_write_integer_backward.cpp`. Twoexp's -2 reference already
  has a valid named predecessor and passes the existing before-symbol rule.
  Game source is unchanged; no new credit is claimed.
- **Remaining / next check:** reconcile real native data placement and the
  existing hex-table owner without duplicating or over-sizing that datum.
  Establish a fresh approved TU/ownership plan before any consolidation; the
  inspected committed map supplies no approved merge for these two units.
  Verify both predecessor and array, other consumers, and one-to-one maps.
  Do not repeat visibility-only or expression changes, add an artificial
  prefix, or weaken the check. Clearance and census confirmation are pending.

### LINK-011: provisional base classes and vtable mismatches in GameEngine subsystems and triggers

**Status: Repair landed / awaiting verification. Updated: 2026-10-25.**

- **Evidence / scope:** several GameEngine units used provisional `Rva...Base` classes
  that declared non-pure virtual functions (`unused()`, `~Class()`) without definitions,
  causing unresolvable vtable and destructor symbol references. In `PolygonTriggerCtor.cpp`,
  a secondary base declared `secondarySlot()` non-pure while `Rva002E3EB8Permuted` declared
  it pure virtual `slot() = 0`. In `Rva003BBAF0Ctor_Rva003FD199.cpp`, `BfmeBaseVNH` vtable
  `??_7BfmeBaseVNH@@6B@` was referenced without being defined. Total scope: 297 authored bytes
  across 4 units.
- **Completed:**
  - `SpecialPowerStore.cpp` (37 B): adopted canonical `SubsystemInterface` directly.
  - `EmotionSystem.cpp` (59 B): adopted canonical `SubsystemInterface` directly.
  - `PolygonTriggerCtor.cpp` (157 B): replaced ad-hoc secondary base with `Rva002E3EB8Base`
    declaring pure virtual `slot() = 0`.
  - `Rva003BBAF0Ctor_Rva003FD199.cpp` (44 B): defined `BfmeBaseVNH` vtable symbol.
  - Verification: `./build.sh` byte-matches all 4 units (5/5 rows); `tools/link_check.py`
    confirms all 4 link cleanly (`LINKED 0 -> 297` bytes).
- **Remaining / next check:** await confirmation in the maintainer's next link census run.
- **Clearance / census confirmation:** cleared in ordinary-preview scope; census confirmation pending.

### LINK-012: shattersystem.cpp's Zero Hour WW3D2 views emit divergent shared COMDATs

**Status: Open (partial repair landed). Updated: 2026-10-25; inspected revision: 70d32d864.**

- **Evidence / scope:** `Code/Libraries/Source/WWVegas/WW3D2/shattersystem.cpp` compiles
  against Zero Hour's `WWLib/Vector.H`, `WW3D2/matinfo.h` and the `meshmatdesclayout`
  shim, and emitted a 75-byte `DynamicVectorClass<VertexMaterialClass*>::Add` while
  retail's folded owner (0x001A3A60, 77 B) is what the six BFME 1-header units emit.
  The census (ef9c691284) kept shattersystem's copy, so every user of that `Add` failed
  `wrong_selected`: MeshLoadContextAddLegacyMaterial.cpp (2,714 B),
  MaterialCollectorDestructor.cpp (1,588 B), MaterialCollectorCollectMaterials.cpp
  (1,489 B), MeshModelReadVertexMaterials.cpp (270 B) and meshmdlio.cpp (352 B).
- **Completed:** shattersystem.cpp declares the `Add` specialization decl-only (before
  matinfo.h, whose inline `Add_Vertex_Material` instantiates it), so it emits no copy.
  `./build.sh` 1/1; `tools/link_check.py` with shattersystem.cpp and each consumer:
  all five consumers LINK (0 -> 6,413 B predicted).
- **Remaining / next check:** shattersystem.cpp still emits non-retail
  `MaterialInfoClass::Add_Vertex_Material` (out-of-line `Add` call where retail 0x00189670
  inlines BFME's `Add`) and `MeshMatDescClass::Peek_Single_Material` (material array at
  +0xA8 in the `meshmatdesclayout` view; retail 0x002C8ECF reads +0xA4). Those keep
  dynamesh.cpp (owner of both rows) and shattersystem.cpp itself from linking. The two
  `Add` bodies are textually identical, so the difference is the views' class layouts:
  reconcile shattersystem.cpp onto the BFME 1 WWLib/WW3D2 headers dynamesh.cpp uses,
  checking its 0x00074643 `Matrix3D::Scale` row.
- **Clearance:** preview scope only (current objects for the listed units).
- **Census confirmation:** awaiting the next census.

## Investigation-specific validation limitation

The initial investigation preserved a pre-existing BFME 1 checkout at
`f5140c1cff6a58e16276fd6de6788186286953d4`, while BFME 2 pinned
`0bf534ea7ccde110c456edb9cd2dd5dae823c953`. Fetching the provider index succeeded,
but normal object import refused that mismatch. No check was bypassed and no
fresh local compile-based preview was claimed. This is a local input limitation,
not evidence that other agents or the whole repository are blocked. Use a
consistent verified checkout before taking new compile-based measurements.

The graphics follow-up above used a separate checkout with the pinned reference
and completed ordinary compile-based verification. The original checkout was
preserved; its mismatch did not block that isolated check. LINK-008 records the
separate strict receipt limitation encountered there.
